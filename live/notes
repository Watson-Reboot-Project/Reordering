## Notes

- The dropdown links in (first the select relation and then) all relations
   need to fetch appropriate values to pick from.
- The accept and cancel buttons still need to be wired up
- The 'active' state in the list-buttons is being weird...
- __Multi-line editor?__
  - to work w/ the walkthrough
  - all the statements at once
- _for join_: 
  - look at 'QueryJoin' in DatabaseServer.java in the watson src tree

### For Mike:

- can create new things?
- ease of modification
  - either a tool for mike, or not
  - separation of data and logic

- - -

- "play with this" button
- reset button
- single stepping through statements
- How do i make this come alive?

- - -

- don't want 15 instances of the same thing
- need a way to 'link' things, per se

- - -

- infinite loop checker
- query user and such
