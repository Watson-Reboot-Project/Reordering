				<strong>4.1 Introduction</strong>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Compared to other human endeavors, the history of computing is relatively short.   In addition, the field evolves quite rapidly.  Thus, there are many questions of a societal nature that have not been fully settled.  This chapter explores some of the social, legal, and ethical issues raised by the widespread application of computing and communications technologies.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Do you have a legal right to record police as they question and/or arrest an individual; and is it ok for you to post such videos to YouTube?  Are you responsible for all of the Internet traffic that passes through your wireless router?  Is it wrong for supermarkets to collect data on their customers and to sell that data to marketing agencies?  Does free speech extend to the right to post and view erotic images online?  Should it be considered ok for two friends to swap MP3 music files?  Do ordinary people have the right to freely exchange messages written in unbreakable codes?  Ought computing professionals be licensed, like doctors, lawyers, and accountants?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In this chapter we will examine these and other questions, which are being actively debated by our society.  The presentation is divided into two parts.  The first part of the chapter looks at issues that are relevant to the general public.  The second part of the chapter focuses on issues of concern to computing professionals.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We live in an exciting time – a time in which the basic laws defining personal privacy, freedom of expression, intellectual property rights and protections, and what constitutes criminal behavior in the online world are being drafted by legislatures and tested in the courts.  Citizens of representative democracies owe it to themselves to become educated about these issues, so that they can help shape the direction of future laws. 			
			</p>
			
			<p class = "Section">
				<strong>4.2 Issues of interest to the general public</strong>			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
			
				<li>Security and privacy</li>		
				<li>Freedom of expression in the online world</li>

			</ul>
			
			<p class = "Section">
			4.2.1 Security and privacy 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Two issues of great importance to anyone who uses the Internet are security and privacy.  <strong>Security</strong> is concerned with how well information is protected from unauthorized access.  <strong>Privacy</strong> focuses on what information should be protected and from whom.  Determining the measures that should be taken to prevent unauthorized access to your bank account is a security issue.  Whether credit card companies should be allowed to sell your purchasing history is a privacy issue.
			</p>
			
			<p class = "Section">
			4.2.1.1 Protecting online accounts from unauthorized access 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Online security is most frequently addressed by password protection. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Most online services – from Facebook, YouTube, and Gmail, to eBay, Amazon, and iTunes – require that each individual who is authorized to use the service have a unique “user account” and password.  Accounts are usually identified by some “account name”, which may be based on the user’s real name or initials (in the case of email addresses), or some preferred “online nickname”.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Because account names are often public in nature, there must be some way of protecting the accounts from unauthorized access.  This is usually accomplished with a private password for each account, known only to the account’s owner.  When someone attempts to log in to an online service, the computer system underlying that service requests two pieces of information – the account name and matching password.  Without the matching password the system will not give access to the specified account.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In order for a computer system to be able to match an account name with the appropriate password, the system needs a record of which passwords go with which accounts.  This information is usually stored in a “password file”.  Whenever an individual attempts to log on to the system, the password file is accessed in order to verify that a valid account name and password were entered.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The existence of a password file, while necessary, presents a potential security weakness.  The password file is a “high value” target for would-be hackers, as it holds, in some sense, the “keys” to all of the accounts maintained by the system.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Surprisingly, even if a hacker manages to get his or her hands on the password file, he or she does not automatically obtain access to all of the end-user accounts on the system.  The reason for this is that passwords are almost always encrypted.  <strong>Encryption</strong> systems store messages in a secret code.  Password files generally consist of account names together with an encrypted version of the associated password.  When a user types in his or her password, the computer system immediately encrypts that password (using standard encryption algorithms such as SHA1, DES, and MD5) and then compares the encrypted version of the just-typed password against the encrypted password stored in the password file.  If the encrypted version of what the user typed matches the encrypted password
from the file, the user is given access to the account.			
			</p>
			
			<h1>INSERT FIGURE 4.1</h1>
			
			<p class = "Figure">
				Figure 4.1:  The password verification process		
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Figure 4.1 illustrates password verification as a four-step process.  First, a user enters his or her account name and password.  In the example, the account name is assumed to be “mike” and the password “acat”.<a href = "#ftnl1" id = "body_ftnl1">1</a>  In the second step the password, but not the account name, is encrypted.  In Figure 4.1, “acat” is converted to “qrtz” by the encryption function.  Next, the password file is searched to determine the encrypted password that is on record as matching account “mike”.  According to Figure 4.1 that password is “qrtz”.  In the final step the two encrypted passwords are compared.  If they match, access to the account is granted.  If they do not match, access to the account is denied.  In our example, the password file
entry for “mike”, “qrtz”, does match the encrypted version of the entered password, so access to the account is granted.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				What would-be hackers intent on stealing a system’s password file soon discover is that having a copy of the password file does not in and of itself give them access to the end-user accounts.  The password file contains encrypted passwords but the computer system requires that an unencrypted password be entered to gain access to an account.  If someone were to steal the password file of Figure 4.1, they would learn that my encrypted password is “qrtz”.  Let’s say they tried to use this information to hack my account by typing in my account name “mike” and the password “qrtz”.  The system will treat “qrtz” just like any other password and thus encrypt it – producing a different stream of characters, perhaps “xpyq”.  When the system compares the (doubly) encrypted
password, “xpyq”, to the encrypted password stored in the password file, “qrtz”, they will not match and access to the account will be denied.  Since there is no way to force the system to skip the password encryption phase of the log in process, knowing the encrypted version of the password does not crack the account.			
			</p>
			
			<p style = "text-indent: 5em;">
				Step 1 –  Prepare a “hacker’s dictionary” that consists of every word in the English language in both encrypted and unencrypted form.  This is accomplished by running every conceivable English word through the password encryption program of the system to be hacked and storing both the original input word and the encrypted output word in a table.
			</p>
			
			<p style = "text-indent: 5em;">
				Step 2 –  Obtain a copy of the password file for the system you wish to hack.  This is often not as hard to do as one might think.			
			</p>
			
			<p style = "text-indent: 5em;">
				Step 3 –  Scan through your copy of the password file, comparing each encrypted password to every encrypted word in your hacker’s dictionary.  Every time you find an encrypted password that also appears in your hacker’s dictionary, retrieve its unencrypted version.			
			</p>
			
			<p style = "text-indent: 5em;">
				Step 4 –  At the end of this process you will have the account names and unencrypted passwords for all accounts that used simple English words as their passwords.			
			</p>
			
			<p style = "text-indent: 5em;">
				Step 5 – Plunder.	
			</p>
			
			<p class = "Figure">
				Figure 4.2:  The “Classic” Dictionary Hack	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Encryption systems exist today that make it virtually impossible to directly figure out what the original password was given the encoded password.  These systems are based on what are called “one way” functions – functions that are easy to compute but whose inverse is extremely difficult to compute.  In other words, given a reasonably long input word, such as a ten character password, these systems can quickly encrypt that word.  But, given the encrypted version of the word, determining the original word may take hundreds or thousands of years on the fastest computers.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				While these “one way” functions do provide some protection, because they make it nearly impossible to derive the original unencrypted password from its encrypted form, there is, unfortunately, a “back door” approach that renders many, if not most, end-user accounts highly susceptible to hacking.  The attack is based on an observation – humans are not very good at coming up with passwords.  When asked to define a password for a new account we don’t tend to generate (and remember) random strings of characters, instead we tend to use common words, phrases, and names for our passwords.  Worse still we tend to use the same password for multiple accounts.   Hackers can exploit this human weakness by encrypting every word in the English language one at a time and storing both the original
word and its encrypted version in a “hacker’s dictionary”.  			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Assuming a hacker has obtained a copy a system’s password file, once that hacker has access to a hacker’s dictionary breaking into accounts that are protected by dictionary words is easy.  The program retrieves the account name and encrypted password from the password file; it then looks up the associated unencrypted version of the password in its dictionary.  If the encrypted password appears in the hacker’s dictionary, the associated unencrypted word is returned.  At this point, the program has both the account name and original password – hence, it has complete access to the account and all of the user’s files.  It could make copies of the user’s files or even delete all of his or her data. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The “dictionary hack” procedure is summarized in Figure 4.2.  These details are not presented to encourage hacking, but are instead included in this text so that the naïve user can gain insight into the methods used by hackers and thereby better protect themselves from attack.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The only way of protecting against this sort of attack is to be sure that your password is does not consist of any word that could be looked up in a dictionary.  Additionally, try to avoid phrases composed of common words.  It is critical that your password be as long as possible – I recommend at least 10 characters.<a href = "#ftnl2" id = "body_ftnl2">2</a>  It is also a good idea to incorporate some digits and special characters (such as: ! @ # $ % ^ & *) into your password.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				With each passing year, password hacking techniques become more and more sophisticated, the “coverage” of hacker dictionaries become more complete, and the hardware they crack with becomes faster.  Thus, a decade ago using a six or eight character password consisting of a common word followed by a three digit number might have provided sufficient protection, but today such a password provides very little protection.			
			</p>

				4.2.1.2 The encryption debate		
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Encryption technology basically comes in two flavors: weak encryption and strong encryption.  <strong>Weak encryption</strong> systems provide a degree of protection but can be cracked with some effort.  <strong>Strong encryption</strong> systems are, by their very nature, virtually uncrackable.  In the 1990’s strong encryption became the focus of intense political debate.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Just as passwords can be encrypted, data files, email, and web traffic can also be encrypted.<a href = "#ftnl3" id = "body_ftnl3">3</a>  As access to strong encryption technologies, such as Phil Zimmermann’s PGP (Pretty Good Protection) software, increased throughout the 1990’s government agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), became concerned that strong encryption would hamper their ability to gather information on suspected illegal activities.  How, they asked, will the government be able to prevent terrorist bombings or drug smuggling if criminals can communicate with one another in codes that are unbreakable?  Civil libertarians responded that the Constitution guarantees citizens a right to privacy in their personal affairs.
		
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In 1994, the U.S. government tried to address both concerns with the “Clipper” chip.  Clipper was supposed to be a strong encryption device with a catch.  While it normally would encrypt messages in a way that is secure, each clipper device would have a special “master key” that would allow intercepted messages to be decoded.  The government proposed that each master key would be divided into two parts: one half of the key would be held by one branch of government, while the other half would be held by a different branch of government.  According to the Clipper proposal, only under a court order could the two halves of a key be reunited to allow the government to decrypt the encoded messages of suspected wrongdoers.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Even with the added protection of the master keys being divided, many people felt uncomfortable with the government holding the keys that would enable them to decode private communications.  Other objections to Clipper arose from the fact that the encryption algorithm used by the system was not made public.  In other words, computer scientists outside of the National Security Agency (NSA), where Clipper was developed, could not verify that its encryption really was as secure as the government claimed.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The original 1994 Clipper proposal did not prove popular and was not adopted.  In late 1996, the Clinton Administration proposed a follow on to Clipper that would have placed more control in the hands of industry.  The proposal would have allowed industry to develop strong encryption technology for both domestic and foreign use, as long as the companies maintained backup access keys and were willing to turn these keys over to the government when under court order to do so.  Like the original Clipper proposal, this effort failed to attract popular support.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				One reason for the failure of Clipper and related proposals was that strong encryption techniques, without “government approved” back doors, already existed and were rather widespread by the mid 1990’s.  Why would someone use a product that allowed the government to listen in (under certain circumstances) when other products existed that were completely secure, opponents asked?
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The encryption debate was complicated by the fact that the U.S. government has historically considered encryption technology (both encryption software and hardware) to be munitions (i.e., weapons).  Though restrictions have eased in recent years, in the past it was illegal to export products that included strong encryption technology.  Many groups pointed out the futility of such export controls, since encryption algorithms had been widely published in the scientific literature throughout the world and strong encryption programs were freely available, at no cost, over the Internet.  They argued that the only result of export restrictions on strong encryption technology was to place U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage in foreign markets. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				By the turn of the century, the encryption debate appeared to be over, with industry and government agreeing that the advantages of strong encryption outweighed its negative aspects.  Efforts to place restrictions on domestic use of strong encryption were abandoned, and export controls on encryption technology were eased.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Immediately following the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center however, there were renewed calls by some in Congress to reopen the encryption debate.  While these efforts failed to gain widespread support, many civil libertarians continue to worry that pressure will eventually build to outlaw use of strong encryption technology by private citizens.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Whether or not our elected representatives and the courts eventually decide that the negative aspects of unbreakable encryption outweigh our right to privacy, we should recognize that a law against strong encryption would be a fundamentally new type of law.  The legality of a communication would be based on the form of the message (the code it was written in) not the content of the message (what it actually says).  Hence, an encrypted diary or series of letters to your fiancée might be deemed just as illegal as an encrypted plan to blow up the White House.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If strong encryption for domestic use is ever made illegal, what would that say about our fundamental right to privacy?  If strong encryption is not outlawed, how will law enforcement agencies protect the citizenry from terrorists and other unsavory individuals?
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Many computer scientists contend that the strong encryption genie has already been released and is so widespread that governments must simply learn to live with it.  Only time will tell what the ultimate effects of strong encryption on law enforcement will be.			
			</p>
			
			<p class = "Section">
				4.2.1.3 Online accounts, email, and privacy			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the above discussion, we asked whether citizens have the right to encrypt their data and email.  Even if the answer to that question is “yes”, the fact is that the vast majority of data and email today are not encrypted.  Does the government have the right to monitor unencrypted email?  It is a commonly held belief among many Internet users that the National Security Agency routinely monitors Internet traffic.  Whether or not this is true, it does show the level of concern that many people express over privacy issues.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Do employers have the right to monitor their employees’ email when that mail is sent over company equipment during working hours?  Prevailing law says yes.  The employer clearly must have some means of making sure employees are doing the job for which they are being paid.  Employers need to be sure that employees are not giving away company secrets, or gossiping with friends on company time.  Furthermore, employers generally own the data files that their employees produce while at work, so surely the employer may inspect such files.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Things become a bit more complicated when the question at hand is whether an employer can monitor an employee’s communications during their personal time.  The accepted standard currently tends to be that yes your employer can monitor communications sent on your personal time if you are using equipment provided by your employer – a company issued mobile smart phone, for example.  Note that even if you paid for your own smart phone, any text messages you might send during your lunch hour could still be fair game for your employer to access if your phone connects to the Internet through your employer’s wireless network.  Because many smart phones automatically connect to the nearest available wi-fi connection, there is concern among some that it is becoming overly complex for individuals to know whether or not a text message or Skype call can legally be considered private or not. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As another example, would you agree that university administrators have the right to monitor their students’ email and other forms of communication when the underlying data is sent over university equipment?  While many students might disagree, universities do have the legal right to do so.    While students are not employees of the university, they do use university computing equipment to perform their “work”.  Students, in a sense, represent their university.  If a student were to post a sexually explicit photo on the Internet using the university’s computer system and that photo ended up on the cover of Time or Newsweek, the university could suffer from adverse publicity.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				What if faculty members or administrators had reason to believe that a group of students were engaged in unethical activities (such as exchanging copies of next week’s history exam) or illegal activities (such as hacking into sensitive government computing facilities) – should they be allowed access to those students’ email messages and data files in order to investigate the situation?  Again, prevailing law says yes.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Next time you log on to your university’s computer network, carefully read the computer usage policy.  You may be surprised to discover that your university retains the right to look at all of the documents you have stored on their systems, regardless of the nature of those documents.  It is also unlikely that your university guarantees (in any legally enforceable manner) to protect your documents from unauthorized access.  In fact, in order to install and maintain software, most computer systems must have a special class of user, known as super users, who have unrestricted access to all files stored on those systems.  Without super user access, your university’s systems personnel could not do their jobs.  However, with such access they have the ability to read any and all unencrypted documents stored on the system – including private email, if they so choose.  This is one reason why great care must be exercised in selecting trustworthy systems personnel.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These questions of privacy are not limited to university students and corporate employees.  These days we all use online services such as Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Skype, YouTube, Google, Amazon, iTunes, and many others.  All of these sites record information about us and update that information every time we access them.  What sort of privacy protections are we legally entitled to?  The answer is “very few”.  While there has been a push in Europe to give individuals legal rights over data they post and data that is collected about them, as of 2012 there is no such legislative push in the United States.  Instead, companies are simply required to inform their customers of the policies the companies themselves have established.  In some cases individuals may “opt out” of some kinds of information sharing but the onus is squarely on the consumer to actively protect their privacy and the options for doing so are often limited.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Before the widespread deployment of the Internet people used to worry about the government collecting data on its citizenry.  Novels such as “1984” painted bleak pictures of the dangers of all seeing, all knowing “Big Brother” governments.  While modern democracies have strict laws designed to protect individual privacy, the rise of ubiquitous computing and communications technologies present challenges to the very notion of privacy.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the second decade of the 21st century, our smart phones have embedded GPS – which makes applications like Google Maps and Turn-by-Turn directions possible, but also enable continuous tracking of our location.   Many of us would find it quite difficult to adjust to life without Google search and the Internet – but we are concerned that when we perform a search or click on a link we almost inevitably leave “digital footprints” behind.  Many of us love to update our Facebook status and post party pics for our friends to enjoy, but are uncomfortable that Facebook retains this data.  Debit and credit cards make life much more convenient, but every time we use another record is added to our purchase history.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There is nothing nefarious behind this drive to collect and retain data.  Online service provides simply want to deliver narrowly targeted advertisements to consumers and thus the more they know about you – like your age, gender, income and educational level, interests, purchase histories, religion, marital status, sexual preference, physical location, etc. – the more they can target the ads they feed you. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Many individuals feel a strong desire for more control over the data they post or that is collected about them.  Some argue for individual “ownership” of “their” data. 			
			</p>		
			
			<p>
				Talk about ease of government in obtaining warrants, or “letters of ……”  and corporations roll over.  Some claim industry in the name of more targeted advertising has amassed data that is trivially avaialbe to government.  Government doesn’t have to collect the data because industry does it for them.  People willing trade their information for convenience.  Where will it end

				4.2.1.4 The marketing of consumer profiles 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In addition to raising privacy issues for newer forms of communication, such as email and instant messaging, the widespread application of computing technology is also calling into question the collating and widespread dissemination of “public” information about individuals. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Before computers existed, it was possible to collect all sorts of personal information about individuals, such as their names, addresses, phone numbers, income levels, spending habits, etc.  Much of this information could be gleaned from property records and various licenses that are, by law, matters of public record in many states.  Even though compiling detailed dossiers has been possible for many years, it was rarely done due to the enormous expense involved in collecting and organizing such information by hand.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Computers have made compiling detailed personal profiles simple and inexpensive.  Reverse telephone books ordered by prefix, zip code, and street address make it easier to target particular ethnic, racial, and income groups.  Every time you subscribe to a magazine, or contribute to a political or humanitarian cause, your name is entered onto a list.  These lists are routinely bought and sold.  Every time you use your credit card to purchase a product, buy an airline ticket, rent a car or hotel room, or even eat in a restaurant, records are kept.  When you check out at the supermarket every single product you buy can be recorded.  If you pay by credit card or even by personal check, that list of items can be linked to your consumer profile.

				While none of this information is very “personal”, the total sum of it can tell you a lot about a person – the things they value, whether they are fiscally conservative, what their political orientation is, their religious beliefs, their marital status, what their favorite brand of beer is and even whether they drink too much of it.  In short, computers make it possible for organizations to know more about people than many individuals feel comfortable with.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The kinds of personal information that ought to be freely bought and sold is still largely unresolved.  At the moment, the prevailing rule seems to be that companies may legally do what they like with the information they collect.  Public pressure, however, appears to prevent most companies from abusing the information they collect.

				4.2.2 Freedom of expression
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Americans have a long tradition of supporting an individual’s fundamental right to freedom of expression.  Our laws specifically protect individuals from persecution for expressing “unpopular” opinions.  While it is understood that the right to free speech will result in some “unsavory” opinions being expressed, a free and open dialogue is seen as the best way of protecting our democratic ideals.  For example, the vast majority of Americans strongly disagree with the intolerant attitudes expressed by individuals such as David Duke,<a href = "#ftnl4" id = "body_ftnl4">4</a> yet they support his right to express his opinions – and even to run for elected office.			
			</p>
			
			<p class = "Section" >
				4.2.2.1 Traditional media and the Internet 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Traditional forms of mass communication such as radio, broadcast television, and to a lesser extent print, have restrictions on what is considered acceptable “speech”.  For example, there are certain words and phrases that may not be used on broadcast television.  Nudity and explicit scenes of sexual intercourse are taboo.  Even in print media, certain publications may not be available for purchase everywhere, due to the existence of local laws banning their sale.  In addition, newspapers and magazines are routinely sued for circulating unsubstantiated stories of a damaging nature.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Currently, there are very few restrictions on what is considered permissible speech on the Internet.  To understand why this is so, we need to examine the rationale for the limited speech approach of television and other media, and compare that to the technological and social factors underlying the Internet.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Traditional media, such as radio and television, are, by their very nature, “broadcast” technologies in which the number of information providers is relatively small, and the number of people receiving the information is very large.  Devices for receiving the signals are mass produced and inexpensive.  Transmission equipment, on the other hand, is quite expensive.  Thus most everyone can listen, but few can speak.  To a somewhat lesser extent this same situation exists with print media.  While anyone can afford to buy a newspaper, few people could afford to print and distribute their own.	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In recent years, word processors, laser printers, and photocopiers, have helped to increase the power of the individual to be “heard” via the written word.  But few would claim that everyone has equal access to the printing press.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The situation in regard to allowing the individual to be heard via traditional radio and television is unlikely to improve.  Only a limited number of channels are available due to the underlying broadcast technology.  This is because each radio station and television channel is transmitted over a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and there is only so much to go around.  Stations that are located physically near one another must be on different channels to avoid interference.  And the range of each station is limited.  Hence most areas of the country have access to only a handful of over-the-air channels.  While cable and direct broadcast satellites have increased the number of available channels to a few hundred or so, this is still an insignificant number compared to the vast audience they must serve.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Because of the basic asymmetry between broadcasters on one hand, and the viewers and listeners on the other, the speech that is permitted by the broadcaster is regulated.  The Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, awards broadcast licenses to radio and television stations.  In exchange for a license to use the public airways, stations must pledge to operate in the public interest and conform to community standards.  In order to establish that they are acting in the public interest, stations often produce material of local interest, such as state and regional news program and public affairs shows.  Stations must be perceived as generally fair and unbiased in their presentation of issues, and work to ensure that a variety of views are represented.  Conforming to community standards means that material deemed by the local community to be “obscene” or patently offensive must be avoided.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Internet grew up under an entirely different set of circumstances.  The most striking technological difference is that the basic asymmetry that exists between information producers and information consumers in traditional media is absent on the Internet.  While the bandwidth of the Internet is finite, there is no concept of “channel”.  The closest analogy is a web site, and there is no limit to the number of web sites that can be constructed.  The cost barriers that limit an individual’s ability to be heard in traditional media are much lower on the Internet.  For about $20 per month, anyone with access to a telephone and modem equipped computer can connect to the Internet via an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  Once on the Internet, any user can put up a web site.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				While traditional broadcast media such as CNN and ABC News do have online versions<a href = "#ftnl5" id = "body_ftnl5">5</a>, the web contains millions of amateur pages.  Many ISP’s will host their customers page’s for free.  In addition, companies such as Yahoo and MSN have created virtual online communities that contain the home pages of hundreds of thousands people.  In fact, the tradition of web surfers constructing their own home pages predates the existence of large professional sites run by big corporations.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The technological reality that every web surfer is a potential content provider as well as a consumer has had a profound effect on how freedom of expression issues are viewed on the Internet.  In general, the Internet community views free speech as a fundamental right and believes that freedom of expression – especially unpopular messages – must be protected.  It is possible to put this lofty ideal into practice on the Internet due to its ability to support an unlimited number of “channels”.  Unlike a newspaper where space is a limiting factor, or a television news broadcast where time is a limiting factor, on the Internet there is no limit to the number of views that can be expressed.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The result of this approach to freedom of expression is that in addition to the exceedingly large number of worthwhile sites on the Internet, there are also areas that contain material that is offensive to the vast majority of humans.  One way of approaching this issue is to think of the Internet, once called “the information superhighway”, literally as a type of highway.  Highways can take you to many fascinating and informative destinations – if you so choose.  They can also take to you to places that are not so pleasant.  The choice is yours.<a href = "#ftnl6" id = "body_ftnl6">6</a>

				4.2.2.2 Legal protections and constraints
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As described above, the Internet has a long tradition of encouraging the free exchange of information and ideas.  This is not surprising since the original users of the Internet were primarily researchers, university faculty and graduate students.  As long ago as the mid 1980’s, when the Internet was a small fraction of the size it is today, there were flourishing online communities devoted to subjects as diverse as particle physics, gay and lesbian issues, gardening, and Star Trek.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the mid 1990’s the size and demographics of Internet changed dramatically with the introduction of graphical browsers and the World Wide Web.  Today, the Internet must serve the needs of a wide cross-section of the public, from researchers to business professionals, from casual surfers to electronic commerce providers, from 12 year olds to seniors.  The diverse nature of today’s Internet user community, which does include many children, has raised concern over the “hands off” policy governing freedom of expression on the Internet.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Since the mid 1990’s there have been a number of legislative attempts to place restrictions on permissible online speech.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The first such attempt was the 1996 Communications Decency Act (CDA), an amendment to the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  The CDA briefly became law when President Clinton signed the Telecommunications Act, but was almost immediately challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  In June 1997, the United States Supreme Court, in Reno v. ACLU, ruled the Communications Decency Act to be unconstitutional because it violated First Amendment freedom of speech guarantees.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The CDA would have made it a crime to:			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>send “obscene or indecent” material to anyone under the age of 18,</li>	
				
				<li>display “obscene or indecent” material in a manner accessible to anyone under the age of 18, or </li>	
				
				<li>allow a computer system under one’s control to be used to display or send such material.</li>	
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				While these provisions may seem quite reasonable, the CDA raised a firestorm of controversy on the Internet.  Certainly, its stated goal of protecting children was laudable, but the Act was written in such a way that essentially <strong>all</strong> publicly available material of an adult nature (both text and images) would have become illegal on the Internet.  Electronic copies of many books that sit on library shelves and works of art that are openly displayed in museums would have been banned.  The only way writers, artists, and public citizens would have been allowed to publish material deemed “indecent” under the law, would have been to ensure that no one under 18 could possibly gain access to their work.  Internet Service Providers that host customer web pages would have been in violation of the law if any of their customers’ web pages were in violation.  Hence ISP’s would either have been forced to police the content of their customers’ pages or (more likely) have discontinued offering to host them.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Ironically, the Communications Decency Act would have had little, if any, effect on most “pornographic” web sites, since these sites generally require payment via credit card and the CDA would have explicitly recognized a verified credit card transaction as proof of adulthood.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The second major attempt to regulate online speech was the 1998 Child Online Protection Act – COPA.  This law would have required web sites to collect “proof of age” before allowing users to view material deemed “harmful to minors”.  For the purposes of this law, a valid credit card number would be considered proof of age.  Unlike the 1996 CDA, the 1998 law provided protections from prosecution for ISPs (Internet Service Providers), telecommunications carriers, and search engine providers.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In February 1999, the federal district court in Philadelphia issued an injunction preventing the government from enforcing COPA.  Later, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals found COPA to be unconstitutional.  In their words, “Because of the peculiar geography-free nature of cyberspace, [COPA’s] community standards test would essentially require every web communication to abide by the most restrictive community’s standards.”			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				On appeal from the Department of Justice, the U.S. Supreme court ruled in May 2002 that COPA was not unconstitutional simply because it relied on “community standards”.  However, rather than declaring the law constitutional, the Supreme Court sent the case back down to the Circuit Court level to determine whether the law might be unconstitutional on other grounds – such as being overly broad or unconstitutionally vague.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In March 2003, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals again found COPA to be unconstitutional – this time on the grounds that it was overly broad and would suppress protected speech adults have a right to engage in.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A third law that addresses online free speech issues is the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), passed by Congress in December 2000.  CIPA requires schools and libraries that receive federal funding to install filtering software on their Internet terminals and PCs in order to block access to obscenity, child pornography, or material harmful to minors.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				CIPA was originally ruled unconstitutional at the U.S. District and Circuit Court levels in May 2002.  The opinion of those justices stated, in part, “Any public library that adheres to CIPA’s conditions will necessarily restrict patrons access to a substantial amount of protected speech in violation of the First Amendment.” 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In June 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the lower court ruling and found the law to be constitutional.  However, the opinions of the Justices make it clear that their decision that CIPA is Constitutional was based, to a large degree, on the Government’s assurance that adult library patrons may (1) ask a librarian to remove the block on any particular web site, and (2) request a librarian to completely disable the blocking lifter on all sites.  Librarians must honor these requests, without requiring adult library patrons to explain why they desire access to particular sites.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				While the federal courts appear to be siding with free speech advocates, the question of whose community standards should apply when judging whether speech is protected or not is still an open question – especially in light of the May 2002 U.S. Supreme Court COPA ruling.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Some people have called for the establishment of “national community standards” in order to prevent online discourse from being limited to the level of what would be acceptable in only the most conservative communities.  Advocates of this approach point to the following case.  In July of 1994, a California-based company that ran a computer bulletin board, known as Amateur Action, was convicted by a United States Federal District Court in Western Tennessee for the interstate distribution of obscene materials.  The definition of “obscene” that was used in the case was based on the local community standards in effect in Tennessee (where a subscriber was located) rather than California (where the company’s computer system was located).  The United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Tennessee decision in January 1996.<a href = "#ftnl7" id = "body_ftnl7">7</a>			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				By 2003, a growing number of individual states had passed laws aimed at restricting online communications based on their local standards.  While the constitutionality of these laws has yet to be tested, if they are upheld, the local standards of the most socially conservative community touched by the Internet could potentially be allowed to dictate what is and is not legally permissible over the entire U.S. portion of the Internet.

				4.2.3  Intellectual property			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This section examines the concept of intellectual property rights.  A brief overview of the history of U.S. copyright law is presented first, followed by a discussion of the “fair use” doctrine and the challenges posed to this concept by digital technology.  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act is examined next.  The section closes with a look at the question of whatever happened to the idea of the digital library.			
			</p>
			
			<p class = "Section">
				4.2.3.1  The history of U.S. copyright law
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Recognition of the importance of intellectual property in the United States dates back to the founding of the nation.  The United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8) states that the Congress shall have the power of “…securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This power was exercised by the first Congress of the United States, which passed the Copyright Act of 1790.  The Act was based on an English law known as the Statute of Anne.  The Statute of Anne, enacted by the English Parliament in 1710, abolished the notion of ownership of a literary work as a perpetual right, and established the modern principle of copyright for a limited term.  Both the English Statute of Anne and the U.S. Copyright Act of 1790 granted protection to a work for a period of 14 years, with the option to renew the copyright for an additional 14 years if the author was alive upon expiration of the original term.  By limiting copyright to fixed terms, these laws established a “public domain” for works whose copyrights had expired.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the three centuries since the passage of the Statue of Anne, copyright laws have been modified numerous times – to broaden the scope of copyright, to extend the terms of protection, and to address new technologies.  In 1831 the term was extended from 14 to 28 years, with an option to extend for 14 more.  The Copyright Act of 1909 kept the primary term at 28 years, but increased the extension to 28 years.  The 1909 Act also extended protection beyond the written word, to other works of authorship, such as music and movies.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Copyright Act of 1976 was a major overhaul of U.S. copyright law, increasing the term of protection to life of the author plus 50 years, and bringing U.S. copyright laws into conformance with those in effect in most European countries.  The 1976 Act applied the new copyright term extension retroactively to all works that were currently under copyright.  The 1976 Act also established a separate copyright term for works that were created “for hire”.  A <strong>work for hire</strong> is a copyrightable work, such as a book, movie, or computer program, which is created by individuals working as employees or contractors for a corporation or other entity.  In such cases, the copyright is owned not by the people who created the work, but by the entity that hired them to do so.  Works for hire, including most movies and music, were given a 75 year copyright term.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In 1998 the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA) extended copyright terms once more.  The revised terms, which were applied retroactively to currently copyrighted works, are life of the author plus 70 years for works authored by a “natural person” and 95 years for “works for hire”.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Some people believe that the repeated increases in the length of copyright, from 28 years at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century to life of the author plus 70 years at the beginning of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, have defeated the primary purpose of copyright term limitations, which was to see that creative works were not owned in perpetuity, but were instead transferred to the public domain after a limited period of time.  They worry that if current trends continue, the entertainment industry will pressure congress to continually extend the terms of copyright protection – forever preventing works produced since 1922 (including most movies and audio recordings) from ever entering the public domain. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Supporters of this view challenged the Constitutionality of the1998 Copyright Term Extension Act.  However, the U.S. Supreme Court did not find their arguments persuasive and affirmed CTEA to be Constitutional by a 7-2 ruling in January 2003.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Now that the Constitutionality of CTEA has been established, supporters of an expanded public domain have turned to other means to accomplish their goals.  One novel approach which seeks to balance the public’s interest in an ever-expanding public domain and the entertainment industry’s interest in protecting commercially viable films, books, and other creative works, is the “Public Domain Enhancement Act of 2003” (also known as the “Eldred Act”).  This act, which is beginning to attract significant public support, would levy a small tax on copyrighted works.  This tax would be due 50 years after initial publication of a work.  If the tax were paid, the work would remain under copyright for the full term congress has set.  If the tax were not paid, the work would enter the public domain.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Supporters of the Eldred Act claim that such a law would have the effect of moving a large number of works that are no longer of commercial value into the public domain.  Placing these works into the public domain would allow libraries and other institutions to preserve and distribute them.  By digitizing this material, many of these works could potentially find new life on the Internet, where they could be easily and cheaply disseminated to a wide audience.			
			</p>

				4.2.3.2  The doctrine of “fair use"
			</p>
			
			<p>
				While copyright protects the interests of the authors or owners of a work for a limited period of time, the doctrine of “fair use” places some restrictions on that copyright protection, in order to protect the rights of consumers and the general public. 	
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Consumers have a basic right to access and enjoy copyrighted works they have lawfully licensed.  Consumers also have some limited rights to share access to their lawfully licensed copyrighted works with others, as long as they are not making a profit in doing so.  These rights mean you can loan your copy of your favorite novel to your best friend, or invite “the gang” over to watch a DVD without violating copyright law.  Consumers also have limited rights to record, for personal use, audio and video broadcasts that they have obtained legal access to.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The rights of researchers, reporters, scholars, teachers, and librarians are also protected by fair use.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The doctrine of “fair use” was first established in the United States by the Supreme Court in 1841 by their decision in “Folsom v. Marsh”.  As with copyright protection, the “fair use” doctrine has been modified numerous times in judicial rulings and legislative acts to broaden its scope and address new technologies.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Copyright Act of 1976 states in Section 107: “the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords … for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.”
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the 1984 decision, “Sony Corporation of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.”, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled by a 5-4 majority that noncommercial home use recording of material broadcast over public airways was a fair use of copyrighted works and did not constitute infringement.  This ruling established the legal right of consumers to “time shift” television programs using VCRs.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 reaffirmed the consumers’ right to use (and retailer’s right to sell) analog and digital audio recording devices.  In order to discourage the illegal production of high quality digital copies, digital recording devices such as Digital Audio Tape, DAT, recorders were required to include a Serial Copy Management System, or SCMS, that would only permit first generation digital-to-digital copies.  Such a system allows a DAT to be made from a CD or first generation DAT, but does not permit a second generation DAT (copy of a copy) to be produced.  Analog recording devices, such as traditional audio tape recorders, were explicitly exempted from the SCMS requirement.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In June of 1999, The United States 9<sup>th</sup> Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that use of portable MP3 players, such as the iPod, does not violate copyright law.  The decision was based on the fact that these devices do not fit the definition of “digital recording device” specified in the 1992 law.  MP3 players cannot record songs, only play them back.			
			</p>
			
			<p class = "Section">
				4.2.3.3  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 was passed by congress in order to implement the treaties signed by the U.S. at the 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Geneva conference.  The law contains numerous provisions, including:			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Requiring “webcasters” to pay licensing fees to record companies,</li>	
				
				<li>Limiting copyright infringement liability for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that simply transmit information, while requiring them to remove material from users’ web sites that appear to be infringing copyright</li>	
				
				<li>Limiting, under certain circumstances, copyright infringement liability for nonprofit institutions of higher education, that act as online service providers, when faculty members or graduate students infringe copyright</li>					
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				In addition to these provisions, which are relatively non-controversial, the law contains another set of provisions that are highly controversial.  These provisions, often referred to as Section 1201,			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Prohibit the act of circumventing a technological measure used by copyright owners to control access to their works, and</li>	
				
				<li>Outlaws the manufacture, sale, or distribution of tools and technologies used for circumventing copy protection schemes.</li>		
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				The DMCA does provide exemptions to these provisions for encryption research, computer security testing and product interoperability; along with exemptions for nonprofit libraries, archives and education institutions – under certain circumstances.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Your reaction at this point is probably “This sounds fair to me.  What’s all the controversy about?”			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				One concern is that by making the act of circumventing a copy protection measure illegal, consumers could be denied the ability to enjoy many well-established “fair uses”.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For example, if a lawfully purchased audio CD includes a copy protection scheme that prevents consumers from making a copy, it would be a crime to “crack” that scheme even if your intent was to make an archival backup copy of the disk – a generally recognized “fair use” of copyrighted material.  It would become illegal to generate MP3 files of copy protected music you had lawfully purchased in order to play those files on your own portable MP3 player – even though the courts have ruled that MP3 players are legal and creating MP3’s of music you have legally purchased is generally considered a fair use.  Audio CD’s are now being released with copy protection schemes designed to prevent them from being played on computers, cracking the protection scheme to make the disks playable on a computer is illegal under the DMCA, even though playing a CD on a computer (as opposed to a CD player) is generally considered a fair use.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Outlawing the tools and technologies used for circumvention also entails a set of problems.  In effect, it bans all tools that can be used for circumvention, even if the tool or technology has many otherwise legal uses.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In July 2001, a Russian programmer, Dmitry Sklyarov, was arrested while in the United States to speak at a conference.  Jailed for several weeks, then detained in the U.S. for an additional five months, Sklyarov’s alleged crime was that he worked on a program known as the “Advanced e-book Processor”.  This program allowed people who had purchased Adobe electronic books, or e-books, to convert them into Adobe’s Portable Document Format, PDF, thereby removing the copyright protection mechanisms embedded into e-books.  Although the e-book processor can be used to “pirate” e-books, it has many useful functions – such as allowing a work released as an e-book to be processed by programs that read to the blind.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As these examples illustrate, the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act have engendered widespread debate over what constitutes fair use.  While the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 and the 1984 Supreme Court ruling in the Sony case appear to support an end user’s right to copy a CD or DVD for noncommercial home use, as of June 2003, there was no legislation or case law that specifically addressed this issue.  The relatively weak legal standing of fair use “rights”, combined with the urgent desire of media companies and legislators to stem music piracy, has brought us to this point.  It will be interesting to see how the desire to maintain fair use while protecting intellectual property rights will be eventually balanced.

				4.2.3.4  Whatever happened to the online library?
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In the early 1990’s when the Internet was just coming into public focus, an analogy that was often used to describe it was “a kind of online library”.  In the decade or so since then, the web has become a wonderful research tool with many excellent news and information sources.  However, it still lacks many of the aspects of a traditional library.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For example, if you have a credit card you can buy most any book, movie, or video you can think of online; but the concept of borrowing a book from a public library is totally absent.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In fact, very few books are freely available online.  While some sites, such as the Internet Public Library <a href = "http://www.ipl.org">(http://www.ipl.org)</a> and Project Gutenberg <a href = "http://www.gutenberg.org">(http://www.gutenberg.org)</a>, do make books freely available online, the offerings of these sites are modest – even compared to a local branch library.  Why?  Well, lack of funds for one, but there are other more serious reasons. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Traditional libraries routinely purchase copies of copyrighted material, which they then make available for lending to the general public.  In the physical word, the expense and hassle of copying a book, means that the library can only lend out as many copies as it has purchased, and that these copies must be returned before they can be loaned to other individuals.  In the digital world, absent a secure digital rights management system, reproducing a copyrighted work is inexpensive and hassle free.  For this reason, online libraries are limited to works that are already in the public domain – effectively limiting them to works published prior to 1923.  Thus, the vast majority of works published in the 20<sup>th</sup> and early 21<sup>st</sup> centuries are unavailable.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If secure digital rights management systems were widely adopted, then an online library could purchase one or two copies of a work and “lend” that work for a fixed period of time.  When a book was due back at the library, the borrower’s ability to access the work would expire, and the library would regain the right to loan the book to someone else.

				4.2.4 Criminal behavior		
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As we have seen above, there is a fair amount of ongoing debate concerning numerous online issues.  However, there is also broad agreement, encoded in numerous laws, defining certain online behaviors as illegal.  Below, we examine two general types of illegal acts.  The first type involves gaining unauthorized access to computing systems.  It may also involve the willful destruction of data.  The second type of behavior concerns unauthorized duplication of copyrighted materials such as programs, data, music, and movies.

				4.2.4.1 Hacking, Trojan Horses, and viruses			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Hacking</strong> generally refers to methods for gaining unauthorized access to computing resources.  The “dictionary hack”, discussed in Section 4.2.1.1, is an example of a hack that can be used to obtain account passwords.  Trojan horses and viruses represent two other types of hacks. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A <strong>Trojan horse</strong> consists of a covert program that hides within another, seemingly innocent, program.  One popular type of Trojan horse tricks unsuspecting users into giving out their password, by masquerading as a system login prompt.  When such a program is running, the computer (or terminal) appears to be unused.  Thus, as users try to log in by typing their account names and passwords, the Trojan horse will record this information for its owner.  After a “victim” has entered his or her password, the Trojan horse either allows the victim to log in normally or “fakes” a network problem or some other type of error.  Other types of Trojan horses are more malicious.  They contain “code bombs” which can do nasty things, such as corrupt the files on a disk drive.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Viruses</strong> are self-replicating computer programs that attach themselves to disk files and email messages.  They are generally spread from computer to computer by networks or infected floppy disks.  Some viruses are mostly harmless – limiting their mischief to displaying annoying messages.  Other viruses are more serious, and can damage or destroy the contents of infected files.  Unfortunately, creating programs such as Trojan horses and viruses that exhibit destructive behavior is not very difficult.  All it takes is a smattering of programming and systems knowledge, plus a willingness to engage in socially deviant behavior.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For the most part, hackers mean no harm.  Typically, they are young men (15-25) who are bright underachievers.  Most exhibit a profound lack of social skills.  From their point of view, hacking is seen as a way to show off how clever they are.  To them, hacking is a game, a stimulating contest of wits with the sys admins (the administrative personnel who run the computer systems).  Winning the game gives the hacker a sense of power.  It validates their sense of self worth.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				From the point of view of most systems personnel, hackers are dweebs who need to grow up, get a life, and stop causing them headaches.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				What would-be hackers need to realize is that their actions cause real damage that costs real money to repair.  Even relatively benign hacks (that just print silly messages) interrupt work and take time to correct.  When a systems administrator who makes $60,000 a year ends up spending most of a day stamping out a viral infection or going through logs to track down who is responsible for a break-in, that translates into about $250.  If data files are damaged – either accidentally or intentionally – they must be restored from backup and all changes since the last backup reentered.  Such an incident can easily cost an organization, such as a business or university, many thousands of dollars.  It doesn’t take many kids “just having fun” for this situation to cost real money. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Hackers need to be aware that if and when they are caught, the outside world will not consider their actions to be part of a game.  They will be charged with real crimes and subject to real penalties.  People go to jail, even for “innocent” hacking.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I’ll close this section by saying that while the hacking problem is certainly real, in the opinion of this author it has been blown way out of proportion by the media.  Painting pictures of impending doom helps sell newspapers and magazines, and boosts ratings – not to mention the sales of virus protection software.  But, in two decades of extensive interaction with computer systems I have never, to my knowledge, lost a program or data file as a result of a hack, even though I take no extraordinary precautions to protect against them.<a href = "#ftnl8" id = "body_ftnl8">8</a>

				4.2.4.2 Software Piracy 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A decade or more ago when programs were routinely distributed on easy to copy floppy disks, software companies took active measures to copy protect their products against illegal copying.  This quickly escalated into a game of hackers versus software companies: where the hackers would break copy protection schemes almost as quickly as software producers could implement them.  When software distribution shifted to CD-ROM in the mid 1990’s, the problem improved for a while because CDs were harder to copy than disks.  By the late 1990’s, the proliferation of the Internet, combined with inexpensive CD-ROM burners, lead to an explosion of software copyright infringement.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Software piracy</strong> is the unauthorized duplication of copyrighted programs and data.  In developed nations, the concept of intellectual property rights has been widely accepted for hundreds of years.  This principle, which was originally applied to books recognizes that these products require time, effort, and talent to produce, and therefore should be protected against unlicensed copying.  Computer software is now considered to be protected as well. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Two decades ago when personal computers were first being developed, most people held the opinion that making copies of computer programs, such as games, wasn’t really stealing, since copying did not deprive the owner of the benefits of the product.  As the PC software industry began to grow, software producers countered that flooding the market with unlicensed copies of software deprived the people who wrote the programs of the royalties they deserved.  They warned that if the practice continued, progress in software development would halt, since companies would have no incentive to devote the resources necessary to produce software if their products could not be protected by law. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The courts, and many people, quickly accepted this argument.  Many other people have not yet been convinced.  A substantial fraction of the user population – people who would never consider shoplifting or most other forms of theft – make illegal copies of programs without any hesitation. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Why?  They have no fear of getting caught?  Perhaps.  But, to me at least, it seems more likely that they don’t really believe they have done anything “wrong”.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Some groups, such as the GNU Free Software Foundation<a href = "#ftnl9" id = "body_ftnl9">9</a> argue that the concept of “ownership” should not apply to software, since it is “the intellectual heritage of all”.  GNU, rather than using their philosophy simply as an excuse for copyright infringement, have instead developed a large number of very popular applications, such as databases, compilers, and text editors that they make available for free.  Even those who disagree with GNU’s philosophy respect their willingness to “put their money where their mouth is” and frequently use their products.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In addition to GNU’s philosophy, there are many other, somewhat more mundane, reasons people give for making illegal copies of programs and data.  The arguments that tend to be popular with undergraduate computer science students include:			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Software piracy is not stealing.  It doesn’t involve “taking” anything.  If I make a copy of a program for a friend, I am helping that person out.  If I accept a copy from a friend, they are helping me out.  Nobody is “stealing” anything. </li>	
				
				<li>Hey, I buy software!  When I get a copy from a friend, I am just trying it out to see whether I like it.  If so, I’ll buy it.  If not, I won’t.  This argument usually includes a justification by analogy such as: You wouldn’t buy a pair of shoes without first trying them on would you?  So why should I buy software without first trying it out.</li>	
				
				<li>I’m a poor college student.  I can’t afford to pay for the software and I have got to have it for class.  Frequently this argument is accompanied by a statement such as, “If software companies didn’t charge outrageous prices for their software, I could afford to buy it.”</li>
				
				<li>“MegaSoft” only produces bug ware anyway.  I’m not going to pay money to be their beta tester.</li>	
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				The “software piracy is not stealing” argument conveniently ignores the fact that the result of distributing unlicensed copies of a product is to rob the software producer of potential customers.  True, not everyone who makes or accepts an illegal copy of a program would have bought it, but unarguably some percentage of those people would have been customers.  While persons of good faith can disagree as to what this percentage would be, there can be no doubt that sales are lost to illegal copying.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The “I’m trial testing the software” argument seems somewhat more reasonable, but its major flaw is that people rarely follow through on the “if I like it, then I’ll buy it” part.  Not because they intentionally mean to deprive the producer of coinage.  On the contrary, many intend to “eventually” buy the product.  They just never get around to it.  Six months or a year go by and an even better program comes along.  The user moves on to this new product and quickly forgets about paying for the old product.  (After all, they’re not using it anymore, so why should they pay for it now?) 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A perfect example of the problem with this argument is the “shareware” phenomenon.  <strong>Shareware</strong> is “for sale” software that anyone may freely download over the Internet.  The authors of the software encourage people to try out the program – usually for 30 days free.  If the person who downloaded the program likes and uses it, then he or she is instructed to send a small fee to the author.  Shareware programs generally continue to work after the “30 day free trial”, but when launched display a reminder to send in the shareware fee.  Many shareware programs (e.g., WinZip) are very popular, yet, as a percentage of total users, very few people actually take the time to send in their shareware fee.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The “I’m a poor student” argument is more a rationalization for committing theft, than an argument that illegally copying software is somehow morally justifiable.  In response, I would simply point out that most students find money for the things that are important to them – like textbooks, pizza, and beer.  They buy those things instead of stealing them.  As far as the “software is overpriced” comment goes, the economic reality is that in order for a software company to hold profits steady, when fewer people buy a program the per copy price must be higher.  The few who actually buy a product end up paying for the many who illegally copy it.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The last argument – “It’s too buggy to buy” – attempts to imply that the software is worthless.  If such were the case, then why would people waste their time copying it?  Obviously, those who want the product must see some value in it.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				One perceived difference between software copyright and other forms of copyright, that might help explain some people’s unwillingness to respect this law, is where the profits go.  Royalties from most creative works, such as music, books, even films go (at least in part) to the authors of the work.  Software, on the other hand, is predominately written by employees of large companies who work on salary.  Hence, profits are generally seen as going to a faceless corporation rather than to an individual or small group who are identified with authorship.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Even if this is the case, I must admit that one aspect of the software piracy situation leaves me completely baffled.  Why is it that a disproportionate number of students who study computing (in the hopes of getting high paying jobs developing software upon graduation), tend to be among the most actively engaged in piracy?  If there were ever a group who had something to gain by seeing that software copyright laws were respected it would be them.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Regardless of one’s philosophical view on the question of software piracy, everyone needs to realize that violating software copyright is a crime and that there are real penalties for doing so.  Individuals who engage in such actions must be prepared to face the consequences – regardless of how unlikely they think those consequences are to occur.  It is also worth noting that the excuse “everyone else is doing it” does not hold up well in a court of law.

				4.2.4.3 Music and video piracy			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century has witnessed the rise, or more accurately the explosion, of a new form of “software” piracy – the “trading” (i.e., illegal copying) of music and (to an increasing degree) video files.  The reasons for this phenomenon are complex, but include, in part, the widespread penetration of broadband Internet connections combined with the rapid adoption of the MP3 music compression format.  

Instant messaging programs that support file transfer make “giving” a copy of a song to someone thousands of miles away almost as simple as handing the CD to someone in the same room.  Assuming that both the sender and receiver are connected to the Internet via a cable or DSL modem, a copy of a song can be transferred from one computer to another in about the same amount of time it takes to play the song – regardless of the physical distance between the sender and receiver.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In addition to instant messaging applications, distributed peer-to-peer networks like KaZaA, Morpheus, Bearshare, and BitTorrent encourage the widespread illegal copying of copyrighted material by providing listings of, and links to, available material.  These programs also enable the “trading” of movies and episodes of popular TV shows by allowing a computer to download multiple parts of a video or music file simultaneously from different servers – substantially improving download times. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				However, even with cable and DSL modems – a reasonable quality MPEG encoded movie (one with somewhat less quality than that of a VCR tape) can still require six hours or more to fully download.  This extended download time currently limits the popularity of video piracy.  As available bandwidth continues to increase, media companies are becoming more and more concerned that video copyright will soon face the same challenges that music now faces.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Exacerbating the music and video piracy problem is the fact that playback of downloaded music and video is not limited to computers.  Downloaded files can be burned to CD and DVD, enabling music to be played on traditional CD players and movies to be played on DVD players.  Additionally, portable music players can store and playback songs encoded in the MP3 file format, allowing pirated music to be played while “on the go”.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In many ways, music and video piracy is similar to traditional software piracy.  However, unlike as is the case with software piracy, music and video pirates usually don’t even attempt to justify their actions – instead admitting they are breaking copyright law.  Thus one wonders why millions of people who would never think of committing traditional forms of theft, trade MP3s with abandon.  Perhaps people are so used to “free” music via commercial radio, “free” video via broadcast television, and “unlimited” access to movies (including taping privileges) via cable that the idea that it is “wrong” to trade movies and music online just has not taken root.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Some have suggested that the ultimate solution to the media piracy problem lies in music companies adopting a consumer model similar to that of cable TV – one in which customers would “subscribe” to music.  Such a subscription would give an individual access to the entire music catalog owned (or licensed) by the service.  The concept could even be extended to multiple levels of subscriptions – with consumers paying more to have access to the very latest releases.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Whatever the ultimate solution to this problem turns out to be, music and video pirates need to understand that while the likelihood of prosecution is low, trading MP3’s and videos online does constitute copyright infringement and is illegal.  As with software piracy, the defense that “everyone else is doing it” does not hold up in court.

				4.2.5 A global perspective			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The above discussions of privacy, encryption, freedom of expression, intellectual property, and criminal behavior tended to treat the Internet as an American phenomenon.  The reality is that the Internet is a global network.  In fact, because the Internet allows people from all over the world to come together and share their common interests, it is doing much to bring about the so-called “global village”. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Certainly the global village is a good thing.  If for no other reason, it decreases the likelihood of war by increasing cross-cultural understanding.  When the citizens of the nations of the world chat daily over the Internet, the government of one nation will probably find it difficult to convince their populace that the people of another nation are their enemies.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The global village aspects of the Internet also introduce a number of problems.  In some countries political debate is encouraged, in others it is discouraged.  Some cultures are strictly monotheistic and frown strongly on open discussion of religious options.  Views on sex, nudity, and the portrayal of violence in the media also vary from culture to culture.  As a result, the laws governing these and many other topics vary widely from country to country.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The distributed nature of the Internet raises a number of vexing legal questions.  When information is stored on servers that exist in numerous countries located throughout the world, and that information is routinely transferred from continent to continent, whose laws should apply?  The laws that are in effect where the servers are located?  The laws that are in effect at each user’s location?  The laws that are in effect where the nodes and fiber optic cables (through which the data are transferred) are located?  Or do the laws at all of these locations apply?  If so, will the contents of the Internet be sanitized to such a degree that no individual, group, or country could possibly find them objectionable? 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These questions are very thorny.  As we have seen, even when the question of applicable law is limited to a single country, such as the United States, the answers are still unclear. How then can we hope to settle these issues on an international level?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Before mass communication and the rise of the Internet, cultural differences could more or less be reflected in regional laws.  This was because people with similar beliefs tended to live physically near one another.  As can be seen in the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals Child Online Protection Act ruling, people are beginning to question whether laws based on geographic location make sense for the Internet, especially those that are aimed at enforcing community standards.  

Some individuals go so far as to argue that laws should be crafted that would be based on the standards of virtual online communities.  Under such a system, it might be illegal, for example, to post an erotic image to a family-oriented discussion group which serves one community, but perfectly acceptable to post the same image to an adult-oriented group which serves another community.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Given that the question of whose laws should apply to the Internet is far from settled on the national level, it is clear that it will take years, if not decades, to unravel this legal knot on the international level.  In the opinion of this author, however, the gains to be derived from a vibrant global Internet far outweigh the problems that will inevitably arise due to its construction.

				<strong>4.3  Issues of interest to computing professionals</strong>			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Section 4.2 of this chapter looked at a variety of issues that were of general interest to the individuals who interact with, or are dependent on, computing and communication systems – essentially everyone who lives in a developed nation.  In this section we narrow our focus to issues that are of interest to the computing professional.  These issues include accountability, liability, and professional licensing; and an examination of the ACM Code of conduct.			
			</p>
			
			<p class = "Section">
				4.3.1 Accountability, liability, and professional licensing			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In June of 1996 an unmanned Ariane 5 rocket blew up approximately 30 seconds after launch.  The launch of this rocket, the first of its kind, was supposed to serve as a demonstration of the capabilities and reliability of the new Ariane 5 series.  It was to be the culmination of a 10 year $8 billion dollar development effort on the part of the European Space Agency – ushering in an era of world dominance in the satellite launch industry.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Instead, this disaster cost the European space program at least a billion dollars and well over a year in redesigns and additional tests.  Software in the guidance control computer was discovered to be at fault.  Instead of keeping the rocket on course, the system suffered a complete loss of guidance and attitude information 30 seconds after lift off – causing the launcher to tilt sharply and tear itself apart.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In August of 1997 a Boeing 747 aircraft crashed in bad weather over mountainous terrain in Guam.  A factor contributing to the crash was discovered to be a software bug in the airport’s Radar Minimum Safe Altitude Warning System.  The bug, which ironically was introduced during an upgrade of the system, reduced the area scanned from a fifty-five nautical mile radius around the airport to a narrow one-mile wide strip along the circumference of the area to be scanned.  If this backup system had been functioning properly, officials believe it likely that the plane would not have crashed and the lives of 226 people could have been saved. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				One of the worst cases of software failure leading to the loss of human life occurred between June 1985 and January 1987 when at least six people suffered massive radiation overdoses from Therac-25 radiation therapy machines.<a href = "#ftnl10" id = "body_ftnl10">10</a>  Each of the exposed individuals suffered severe radiation burns.  Three patients died as a result of these overdoses.  The others sustained serious injuries.  All lawsuits arising from the incidents were settled out of court.  An official investigation into the accidents was never performed.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Creating reliable software is very difficult.  As alluded to in Chapter 1, and discussed in detail in Chapter 13, it is impossible to prove that any non-trivial program is bug free.  Complicating this fact is the reality that most software is produced by large teams of programmers working long hours under tight schedules.  The best that can be done is to create software using modern development tools and techniques, and to rigorously test that software during production in order to discover and correct as many bugs as possible.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				How does one ensure that software designers exercise due caution when writing programs, that they take all reasonable measures to produce software that is as reliable and error free as possible?  And what happens when things go wrong – as they inevitably will in some cases?  Should people be able to sue for damages?  If so, who should be held responsible?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These questions are related to the concepts of accountability and liability.  Accountability is concerned with determining who is responsible for an action being taken or an event occurring.  Some aspects of accountability are related to management, other aspects to ethics.  Liability, on the other hand, is a legal question – it concerns who pays when things go wrong, and what limits, if any, should apply to the amounts that can be claimed for damages as the result of an accident or software failure.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The position taken in most software warranty statements is that the liability of the producer of the software is limited to the price paid for the software.  Most software companies claim they will not be held liable for any incidental damages that may occur due to use of their programs, even if the damages directly result from known bugs in the program.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For example, say you just spent the last nine months writing a book and as you type the last page of the 500-page manuscript, a bug in the word processor causes your document and all of its backups to be deleted.  The position of most software producers, under such an admittedly unlikely situation, is that they will not be held liable for your loss of data – even if it were to turn out that a disgruntled employee had purposefully inserted code to delete all document files when the user typed the words “the end”.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Of course, just because software companies say they refuse to be liable for damages beyond the cost of the program, does not mean that the courts will agree with them.  So far, the question of liability remains pretty much an unsettled issue.  There have been few high profile court cases for civil restitution or criminal negligence against software producers.  In fact, most consumers appear to have accepted the notion that applications will occasionally fail, in the process causing them to lose some minutes (or hours) worth of work.  However, as our dependence on life-critical software systems steadily increases, it is probably just a matter of time before the issue of software liability comes to a head.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Let’s consider what might happen if one of the newer fly-by-wire aircraft, which are heavily dependent on embedded computer systems for their safe operation, were to crash – killing all on board.  Further, assume that the accident investigators are able to trace the fault back to a single line of code written by a programmer who worked for one of the aircraft manufacturer’s subcontractors.<a href = "#ftnl11" id = "body_ftnl11">11</a>			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Who should be liable in such a situation?  The airline that bought the plane?  The aircraft manufacturer who built the plane?  The subcontractor who developed the faulty computer program?  The programmer who wrote the line of code that contained the fatal bug?  Depending on the circumstances surrounding the accident, arguments can be made against any and all of these parties.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Most engineers believe that fly-by-wire aircraft, which depend on computer-based electronic systems, are at least as safe as (and probably much safer than) older aircraft designs that depend on electromechanical systems.  However, one could argue that such planes are inherently unsafe, since any trained computer scientist could tell you that the software they depend on can never be proven to be 100% bug free.  According to this argument, since such knowledge is widely known among computing professionals, surely an airline exercising due caution should have avoided purchasing such a plane.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A similar argument can be made against the airplane manufacturer.  While the component that failed was built by a subcontractor in our example, the manufacturer of the plane is still ultimately responsible for the performance of its product.  Since software is so notoriously unreliable, shouldn’t the manufacturer have avoided designing planes that depend so heavily on it?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				What about the subcontractor that wrote the program containing the bug?  Did they not deliver a faulty product to the airplane manufacturer?  Shouldn’t they have to pay some sort of damages?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				And what of the programmer?  The man or woman who actually wrote the line of code that eventually caused the plane full of people to die.  Is he or she not ultimately responsible and therefore liable?  Many would argue yes.  However, it is impossible for human beings to write perfect code.  That is why code must be tested, retested, and tested again.  If the company’s testing program failed to catch the bug, can the programmer really be held responsible for this tragedy?  Even if there is every indication that the programmer was in no way negligent?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				What if the opposite was the case – the programmer was grossly negligent, an alcoholic crack addict going through a messy divorce who hadn’t had a sober day in six months – at the very least the programmer should be “disbarred” from computing, right?			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The unfortunate truth, that most people outside of computing would be shocked to learn, is that computing professionals are <em>not licensed</em>.  This is in stark contrast to most other professions.  Doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers – all have professional licensing agencies.  To be granted a license to practice, an individual must demonstrate minimum levels of competence.  Such agencies typically retain the power to revoke the licenses of disreputable or incompetent individuals – thereby stripping them of their ability to earn an income.  This ability can serve as a powerful check against abuses of professional status.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You might be wondering why computing professionals are an exception.  Why are they not licensed?  The reason is that the profession is so new and its practitioners so diverse that no one is yet sure what constitutes minimum standards of professional competence.  In the opinion of this author, students studying to become computing professionals should mentally prepare themselves for the idea of professional licensing.  While it may take the occurrence of a high profile disaster such as the hypothetical one described above, licensing is probably just a matter of time.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Before leaving this topic, I would like for you to consider the idea that lack of liability law is actually holding back computing progress in many areas, such as telemedicine and expert systems.  Tele-medicine involves using computers and communication systems to allow doctors at one location to examine and treat patients at another location.  At its simplest this can be a video conference call where the physician can visually inspect the patient and offer advice.  At the other extreme it can involve surgeons remotely operating on a patient using VR goggles and data gloves to control a “surgical robot”.  The fact that no one is quite sure which laws apply to doctors, patients, equipment manufactures, and software producers under such situations has a chilling effect on bringing innovations to market.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To give a simple example, doctors are licensed on a state-by-state basis.  If a doctor is located in Maine (where she is licensed) but her patient is in West Virginia, is she practicing without a license?  In the area of telemedicine, is it reasonable to expect doctors to obtain separate licenses for each state in which their patients reside?  Or is placing a video telemedicine call to a doctor in Maine similar to getting on a plane and actually traveling to the doctor’s location? 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Medical expert systems provide a final example.  <strong>Expert systems</strong> are computer programs that function at or near the level of a human expert in a narrow problem domain such as infection diagnosis.<a href = "#ftnl12" id = "body_ftnl12">12</a>  While today’s programs are a far cry from the fictional Emergency Medical Holographic Doctor on “Star Trek: Voyager”, some can provide excellent advice on limited aspects of medicine.  However, without means of legal recourse for bad advice their application is extremely limited.  After all, if you knew that no one was legally liable in cases of incorrect diagnosis and ineffectual (or harmful) treatment plans, would you use such a program?  How could you trust its advice?  Furthermore, what company would devote the resources necessary to developing and marketing such a beast?			
			</p>

				4.3.2 ACM Code of Conduct			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Regardless of the fact that computing professionals are not yet licensed, commonly recognized principles for ethical behavior are emerging.  The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the oldest and largest organization of computing professionals, has formalized these principles in their “Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct” which is discussed below.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct of the Association for Computing Machinery<a href = "#ftnl13" id = "body_ftnl13">13</a> attempts to capture in 24 imperatives the essential aspects of ethical behavior.  It is intended to serve as “the basis of ethical decision making in the conduct of professional work” and also as “a basis for judging the merit of a formal complaint pertaining to violation of professional ethical standards”.			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The code is divided into four sections.  The first section addresses “general moral imperatives”, the second “more specific professional responsibilities”, the third section concerns “organizational leadership imperatives”, and the final section “compliance with the code”.

				The general moral imperatives consist of the following eight statements, which are designed to address fundamental ethical considerations:			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Contribute to society and human well-being. </li>		
				
				<li>Avoid harm to others.</li>	
				
				<li>Be honest and trustworthy.</li>
				
				<li>Be fair and take action not to discriminate. </li>
				
				<li>Honor property rights including copyrights and patent.</li>
				
				<li>Give proper credit for intellectual property.</li>
				
				<li>Respect the privacy of others.</li>
				
				<li>Honor confidentiality.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				Under more specific professional responsibilities, the following eight statements are made:			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Strive to achieve the highest quality, effectiveness and dignity in both the process and products of professional work. </li>	
				
				<li>Acquire and maintain professional competence. </li>	
				
				<li>Know and respect existing laws pertaining to professional work. </li>

				<li>Accept and provide appropriate professional review. </li>	
				
				<li>Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks. </li>
				
				<li>Honor contracts, agreements, and assigned responsibilities.</li>
				
				<li>Improve public understanding of computing and its consequences.</li>
				
				<li>Access computing and communication resources only when authorized to do so. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				The third section of the code addresses the ethical obligations of organizations – stating them from the perspective of the organizational leader.  This section consists of the following six imperatives:			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Articulate social responsibilities of members of an organizational unit and encourage full acceptance of those responsibilities.</li>	
				
				<li>Manage personnel and resources to design and build information systems that enhance the quality of working life. </li>		
				
				<li>Acknowledge and support proper and authorized uses of an organization’s computing and communication resources. </li>
				
				<li>Ensure that users and those who will be affected by a system have their needs clearly articulated during the assessment and design of requirements; later the system must be validated to meet requirements. </li>
				
				<li>Articulate and support policies that protect the dignity of users and others affected by a computing system. </li>
				
				<li>Create opportunities for members of the organization to learn the principles and limitations of computer systems. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				The final section of the code deals with compliance and consists of the following two statements:			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Uphold and promote the principles of this Code. </li>
				
				<li>Treat violations of this Code as inconsistent with membership in the ACM. </li>			
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				Accompanying the code is a set of “guidelines”.  The purpose of these guidelines is to illuminate the principles underlying the statements that form the code and to provide guidance concerning interpretation and application of the code. 			
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The complete text of both the code and its associated guidelines is included in an Appendix to this text.  The student is encouraged to read the code and its guidelines and to carefully reflect on their content. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In addition to the general ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct discussed above, the ACM and IEEE Computer Society have together adopted a joint “Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice”.<a href = "#ftnl14" id = "body_ftnl14">14</a>  The reader is encouraged to download a copy of this code and reflect on its contents as well.

Changes and modifications to the 2012-2013 edition			
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>SECURITY AND PRVACY -- Update the section on password security</li>	
				
				<li>PRIVACY -- What are the potential privacy implications of ubiquitous technologies such as Google Glass? Life loggers, record everything?  What about your right to privacy? </li>	
				
				<li>FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION -- Fred Phelps, Westboro Baptist Church @ GodHatesFags.com, protest of military funerals;  Terry Jones, Dove World Outreach Center (International Burn a Koran Day); “Innocence of the Muslims” Nakoula Basseley Nakoula (aka “Sam Bacile”)</li>
				
				<li>WHAT CONSITITUES CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR? -- Update the legal section – ok to record police during arrests and/or questioning?  Reid Technique, Norfolk Four, Michelle Moore-Bosko, 1997, false/coerced confessions, recording of all police interactions. Wireless router controversy.</li>
				
				<li>GLOBAL PHENOMENON -- Add a section on Cyber Security, Cyber Attacks, and Cyber Warfare, Richard Clarke’s book “Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to Do About it” – argues America is more vulnerable than most because we are so dependent of computing and communications infrastructure – we spend handsomely of Cyber Offense, but almost nothing on cyber defense of critical infrastructure. </li>
