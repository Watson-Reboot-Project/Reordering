				8.1 Introduction
			</p>

			<p>
				We have now reached the halfway point in our discussion of software. As such, this is a good place to review where we have been and to summarize where we are going.
			</p>

			<p>
				Chapter 5 focused on the problem solving process in general and introduced the concept of an algorithm. Chapter 6 presented a simple programming language for drawing graphical images. That language, the Watson Graphics Language (WGL), was used to introduce many of the basic features of imperative programming languages. These features include data types, constants, variables, assignment statements, and output statements; as well as the control constructs “sequence” and “repetition”. The lab that accompanied Chapter 6 gave you an opportunity to explore the behavior of several existing WGL programs, and to begin writing programs yourself. Chapter 7 focused on data structures and addressed the question of how data can be organized to facilitate the problem solving process.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this chapter and the next we will examine the programming process in more detail.
			</p>

			<p>
				Over the past forty years or so, three general classes, or paradigms, of programming languages have emerged. These paradigms include the imperative paradigm, the functional paradigm, and the logical paradigm. In addition, during the past decade or so these paradigms have been extended to include object-oriented features. A language is classified as belonging to a particular paradigm based on the programming features it supports.
			</p>

			<p>
				Object-oriented, imperative languages are, by far, the most popular type of programming languages. Both Java and C++ are object-oriented, imperative languages. The Watson Graphics Language, WGL, is also an imperative language, though it is not object-oriented.
			</p>

			<p>
				This chapter continues the exploration of the imperative paradigm by discussing Watson JavaScript. Watson JavaScript is an extended subset of JavaScript, a widely used imperative programming language incorporated into many web pages. Using Watson JavaScript, we will examine programming structures common to most imperative programming languages. A relatively large number of small programs will be presented in order to illustrate how these program structures can be used to solve problems.
			</p>

			<p>
				The chapter following this one, Chapter 9, discusses the functional and logical programming paradigms. Functional programming is illustrated with the language Lisp. Logic programming is introduced with Prolog. Both of these languages are frequently used in the study of A. I., or artificial intelligence.
			</p>

			<p>
				The last chapter in this part of the book is Chapter 10: Building Large Software Systems. Chapter 10 begins with a discussion of object-oriented programming. Object-oriented features influence the ways in which the parts of a program are organized and how they communicate with one another. Object-oriented languages are extremely useful for writing complex programs that support mouse-based, graphical user interfaces. Chapter 10 also includes an introduction to the field of software engineering, which focuses on the unique challenges that must be faced when constructing large programs, such as those that require many thousands of worker-hours to complete.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Section">
				8.2 An Overview of Watson JavaScript
			</p>

			<p>
				The <span class="Bolded">imperative paradigm</span> is based on the idea that a program is sequence of commands or instructions that the computer is to follow to complete a task. The imperative style of programming is the oldest, and now with object-oriented extensions, continues to be far and away the most popular style of programming.
			</p>

			<p>
				Watson JavaScript is an imperative programming language based on JavaScript.  JavaScript is a popular programming language that is often used for writing small programs that are embedded in web pages. Most web browsers, including Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Mozilla’s FireFox, can run these programs.
			</p>

			<p>
				Watson JavaScript is an “extended subset” of regular JavaScript. By “extended” I mean that Watson JavaScript requires programmers to specify some additional information that full JavaScript does not, such as the type of a variable upon its declaration. By “subset” I mean that Watson JavaScript does not include all of the features of full JavaScript – though it does include all of the basics, and is a complete, general-purpose programming language.
			</p>

			<p>
				One way of thinking about writing Watson JavaScript programs is to compare it to programming full JavaScript with “training wheels” on. Every program you write in Watson JavaScript can be run on most web browsers without modification, but there are many things programmers are allowed to do in full JavaScript that are forbidden in Watson JavaScript. For example, Watson JavaScript forces programmers to do certain things in certain ways, such as declaring all variables at the top of a program, where full JavaScript allows much more flexibility. These restrictions are designed to help beginning programmers avoid making common mistakes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.1 illustrates the general format of a Watson JavaScript program and shows how such a program could be embedded in a simple web page. The first thing to notice about this figure is that much of the text is shown in gray. This gray text is not JavaScript code but is instead HTML, or HyperText Markup Language. In order to run Watson JavaScript programs directly in a web browser, they would need to be embedded within the HTML tags shown in gray. Conversely, the HTML can be omitted when Watson JavaScript programs are created and run within the Watson JavaScript Lab environment available at http://watson.latech.edu.

				Figure 8.1: The format of a Watson JavaScript program embedded within a web page
			</p>

			<p>
				HTML is the language used to write web pages. While the purpose of this chapter is not to teach HTML, I will say a few words about this subject for those of you who might be interested in what all that gray text means.
			</p>

			<p>
				HTML pages are text documents “marked up” with a variety of “tags” that define the structure of the document. Most tags come in pairs such as <span class="Subfigure">&lt;html&gt;</span> and <span class="Subfigure">&lt;/html&gt;</span>. Every valid web page begins with the <span class="Subfigure">&lt;html&gt;</span> opening tag and ends with the <span class="Subfigure">&lt;/html&gt;</span> closing tag. All of the text between these two tags, including other pairs of tags, is part of the HTML document.
			</p>

			<p>
				HTML documents generally consist of two parts, the “head” and the “body”. The head is optional and is omitted in Figure 8.1. The body of an HTML document resides between the opening <span class="Subfigure">&lt;body&gt;</span> and closing <span class="Subfigure">&lt;/body&gt;</span> tags.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of the primary jobs of web browsers is to format the contents of HTML documents and present those documents in an attractive manner. For our purposes, however, we want to turn this feature off so that the output of our Watson JavaScript programs will be presented to the user in exactly the form we specify. Thus, our JavaScript programs will be embedded within <span class="Subfigure">&lt;pre&gt;</span> and <span class="Subfigure">&lt;/pre&gt;</span> tags. These tags tell the web browser that the output has been pre-formatted and should be displayed without modification.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <span class="Subfigure">&lt;script type=”text/javascript”&gt;</span> and <span class="Subfigure">&lt;/script&gt;</span> tags surround the actual JavaScript program. Everything within these tags will be JavaScript code.
			</p>

			<p>
				Watson JavaScript programs consist of two parts, declarations and imperative statements. The <span class="Italicized">declarations</span> define the objects that will be used by the program, while the imperative <span class="Italicized">statements</span> specify how those objects will be manipulated in order to accomplish the actions of the program.

				Figure 8.2: The two kinds of objects (variables and functions) that can be declared in Watson JavaScript Programs
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.2 illustrates the two kinds of objects that can be declared in Watson JavaScript programs. These objects are variables and functions. You may recall from your study of the Watson Graphics Language that variables are named objects that can hold a value of a particular type. Functions are subprograms – programs that occur within other programs. If this idea seems strange at the moment, don’t worry. The usefulness of functions will become apparent as we proceed through this chapter.
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.3 presents all of the statements types available in Watson JavaScript. Every Watson JavaScript program that can ever be written will be formed from these basic building blocks, along with the declarations of Figure 8.2. Surprisingly, this small number of statements is all that is required to give Watson JavaScript the power of a general-purpose programming language.
			</p>

			<p>
				Watson JavaScript statements can be grouped into seven general categories. These categories are: output statements, input statements, variable assignment, selection statements, iteration statements, function invocation, and function return. Each of these categories and the details of the statements that occur within them are discussed below.
			</p>

			<p>
				As mentioned above Watson JavaScript is an extended subset of true JavaScript. Watson JavaScript is not intended as a replacement for full JavaScript – or Java or C++ for that matter. Instead, Watson JavaScript is a teaching tool aimed at simplifying the process of learning to program. Watson JavaScript purposefully omits many features available in full JavaScript and other popular languages, in order to keep the language from becoming overly complex. In addition, the Watson lab that you will most likely use to create your Watson JavaScript programs incorporates a point-and-click interface similar to the one provided by the Watson Graphics Lab. The Watson JavaScript language and its implementation in the lab are designed to help beginning students focus on “the big picture” rather than get bogged down in the complexities inherent in “real” languages and their program development environments.

			<p class="Section">
				8.3 &nbsp; Data types, constants, variables
			</p>

			<div>
				The kinds of values that can be expressed in a programming language are known as its <span class="Bolded">data types</span>. The Watson Graphics Language of Chapter 6 supported data types relevant to drawing graphical images, such as distance, point, circle, and color. Watson JavaScript supports only two data types: text and numbers<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: Full JavaScript includes a third data type called Boolean. Additionally, the type we refer to as “text” in this chapter is generally called “string” when discussing full JavaScript, as opposed to Watson JavaScript."><a href="#ftn1" id="body_ftn1">1</a></span></span>. The <span class="Subfigure">Text</span> data type gives Watson JavaScript the ability to represent non-numeric data such as names, addresses, English phrases, etc. The <span class="Subfigure">Numeric</span> data type allows the language to manipulate numbers, both positive and negative, whole numbers and fractions.
			</div>

			<p>
				You may recall from your study of the Watson Graphics Language that a <span class="Bolded">constant</span> was defined as a value of a particular type that does not change over time. Both numbers and text may be expressed as constants in Watson JavaScript. <span class="Bolded">Numeric constants</span> are composed of the digits 0 through 9 together with an optional leading “+” or “-” sign and an optional decimal point. Numeric constants may not contain commas, dollar signs, or any other special symbols. The following are valid Watson JavaScript numeric constants:
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				+15&nbsp; &nbsp; -150&nbsp; &nbsp; 15.01&nbsp; &nbsp; 3200
			</p>

			<p>
				Due to the nature of the underlying physical hardware, almost all programming languages impose limits on the range of numeric values they can represent. Full JavaScript stores numbers in a standard form called IEEE 754 Double Precision, which supports a very wide range, approximately +/- 10 <span class="T52">+308</span> which is either a “1” or “-1” followed by 308 zeros. Even though the overall range is quite large, the number of significant digits is generally limited to about 15 or so. During our discussion of Watson JavaScript we can safely ignore numeric range limits, since all of the problems we will be working on will use numbers well within the supported range.
			</p>

			<p>
				A <span class="Bolded">text constant</span> consists of a sequence of characters enclosed in double quote marks. The following are examples of valid Watson JavaScript string constants:
			</p>

			<p class="P85">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  “She turned me into a newt.”
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; “I got better.”
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; “Very small rocks.”
			</p>

			<p>
				The value of a text constant is the actual sequence of characters appearing between the quote marks. Hence, <span class="Italicized">The Holy Grail</span> is the value of the text constant <span class="Italicized">“The Holy Grail”</span>. The only character disallowed in a text constant is the double quote mark itself, since that symbol is used to mark the beginning and end of a text string. Hence, the following is not a valid text constant:
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				“I think “Monster House” rules!”
			</p>

			<p>
				In Chapter 6, a <span class="Bolded">variable</span> was defined to be a named object that can store a value of a particular type. Watson JavaScript supports two types of variables: text string variables and numeric variables. Before a variable can be used, its name and type must be declared. All variable declarations in Watson JavaScript are of the form:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				<span class="Subfigure">var</span><span class="Italicized">name</span><span class="Subfigure">; //</span><span class="Italicized">type</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				Hence, a numeric variable named <span class="Subfigure">age</span> could be declared with the following statement:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				var age; // Numeric
			</p>

			<p>
				Similarly, a text variable named <span class="Subfigure">firstName</span> could be declared with the statement:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				var firstName; Text
			</p>

			<p>	It is important for you to realize that while human programmers generally try to give variables names that reflect the use to which they will be put, the variable name itself doesn’t mean anything to the computer.  For example, the numeric variable <span class="Subfigure">age</span> can be used to hold any number<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: Within the supported range."><a href="#ftn2" id="body_ftn2">2</a></span></span>, not just an age. It is perfectly legal for <span class="Subfigure">age</span> to hold the number of students in a class, or the number of eggs in your refrigerator. The computer couldn’t care less. Human programmers, on the other hand, generally care a great deal. They expect a variable’s name to accurately reflect its purpose, so while it is possible to do so, it would be considered poor programming practice to use the variable <span class="Subfigure">age</span> to store anything other than an age.

				8.4 &nbsp; Input and output statements
			</p>

			<p>
				In order for a computer program to perform any useful work, it must be able to communicate with the outside world. The process of communicating with the outside world is known as input/output or I/O. Watson JavaScript includes two output statements for displaying information on the computer’s screen, and two input statements – one for reading in text input, the other for reading in numeric input. Most imperative languages include mechanisms for performing other kinds of I/O such as detecting where the mouse is pointing and accessing the contents of a disk drive.
			</p>

			<p>
				The two output statements included in Watson JavaScript are <span class="Subfigure">document.write</span> and <span class="Subfigure">document.writeln</span>. These statements are of the general form:
			</p>

			<p class="P115">
				<span class="T15">&nbsp; </span><span class="Subfigure">document.write(</span><span class="Italicized">expression</span><span class="Subfigure">);</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="T15">&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; </span><span class="Subfigure">document.writeln(</span><span class="Italicized">expression</span><span class="Subfigure">);</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				where an “expression” can be a constant, a variable, a function call, or a collection of these things connected by appropriate operators. Both the <span class="Subfigure">document.write</span> and <span class="Subfigure">document.writeln</span> statements display the value of an expression on the computer screen. The only difference between the two is that <span class="Subfigure">document.writeln</span> starts a new line after printing the value on the screen. For this reason, <span class="Subfigure">document.writeln</span> is pronounced as if it were written “document write line”.
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.4 contains a simple Watson JavaScript program together with the output produced by the program.

			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				Hello World!
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 8.4: A Watson JavaScript program and its output
			</p>

			<p>
				This program consists of a single instruction:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				document.writeln(“Hello World!”);
			</p>

			<p>
				Since the expression contained in this <span class="Subfigure">document.writeln</span> statement is the text constant “Hello World!”, the program displays the value of that constant on a line by itself, producing the output:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				Hello World!
			</p>

			<p>
				The program of Figure 8.5 illustrates the difference between <span class="Subfigure">document.write</span> and <span class="Subfigure">document.writeln</span>. It also introduces numeric expressions and the concept of sequence. The program consists of three output statements: two <span class="Subfigure">document.write</span> statements followed by a <span class="Subfigure">document.writeln</span>. When run, it produces the following line of output.
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				There are 13 cookies in a baker’s dozen.
			</p>

			<p>
				To understand how this program works we must first recall from our discussion of the Watson Graphics Language that the statements of a program are executed one after another in the order, or <span class="Italicized">sequence</span>, they appear. Hence, the first statement to be executed is:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				document.write(“There are ”);
			</p>

			<p>
				This statement prints the following characters on computer’s display screen:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				There are
			</p>

			<p>
				While it is not apparent in the line shown above, if you look closely at the statement, you will see that a space, or “blank” is supposed to follow the word “are”. Because this statement is a “write” and not a “writeln” a new line of output was not begun after these characters were displayed. Thus, the next program output will immediately follow the characters just printed, on the same line.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="P96">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="Bolded">Program definition:</span>
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				document.write("There are ");
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				document.write(12 + 1);
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				document.writeln(" cookies in a baker’s dozen.");
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Subfigure">&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; </span><span class="Bolded">Program output:</span>
			</p>

			<p class="P85">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				There are 13 cookies in a baker’s dozen.
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 8.5: &nbsp; A Watson JavaScript program that outputs both text and numbers
			</p>

			<p>
				The position that the next character will be printed in is often indicated by the underscore symbol, _. Using this symbol, it is easy to see that a space does indeed follow the word “are” in the output.
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				<span class="Subfigure">There are</span> _
			</p>

			<p>
				The next statement to be executed is:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				document.write(12 + 1);
			</p>

			<p>
				This statement contains the mathematical expression 12 + 1 which evaluates to the number 13. Since “Write” and “WriteLn” statements display the <span class="Italicized">value</span> of an expression, and not the expression itself, 13 will be printed next. The program’s output now looks like the following, with the print position immediately following the 13.
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				<span class="Subfigure">There are 13</span>_
			</p>

			<p>
				It is important that you pay close attention to whether or not an expression is surrounded by quote marks when attempting to determine its value. If an expression is surrounded by quote marks then the characters between those quotes represent the value of the expression. If the expression is not quoted, then its value must be determined by performing the operations specified in the expression. Thus,
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				<span class="Subfigure">document.write(12+1); &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; </span> prints &nbsp;  13
			</p>

			<p>
				but
			</p>

			<p class="P87">
				<span class="Subfigure">document.write(“12+1”); &nbsp;  &nbsp; </span> prints &nbsp;  12 + 1
			</p>

			<p>
				Continuing with the example, the third and last statement of the program
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				document.writeln(“ cookies in a baker’s dozen.”);
			</p>

			<p>
				will now be executed to produce the following:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				There are 13 cookies in a baker’s dozen.
			</p>

			<p class="P78">
				
			</p>

			<p>
				Note that this statement is a “writeln” rather than a “write”, so it moves the print position to the next line. Always remember that <span class="Subfigure">document.writeln</span> statements begin a new line <span class="Italicized">after</span> they print the value of their expression on the screen, not before printing.
			</p>

			<p>
				Another important point to note about this statement is that the text string it contains begins with a blank. This is important since the print position was located immediately after the 13 when this statement was executed. If the leading blank had been omitted from the string, the program would have produced the following result:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				There are 13 cookies in a baker’s dozen.
			</p>

			<p>
				In a sense, Watson JavaScript programs, such as those of Figures 8.4 and 8.5, are quite similar to the Watson Graphics Language (WGL) programs we studied in Chapter 6. Both Watson JavaScript and WGL belong to the imperative paradigm and both are capable of generating output. As we continue our study of Watson JavaScript, many additional similarities will become apparent.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are also significant differences between these languages. For example, the output statements of Watson JavaScript are <span class="Subfigure">document.write</span> and <span class="Subfigure">document.writeln</span> as opposed to <span class="Subfigure">draw</span> and <span class="Subfigure">erase</span> in WGL. Another difference between Watson JavaScript and WGL is that every WGL program always produces exactly the same output every time it is run. When using WGL, every unique drawing or animation requires that a separate program be written. Likewise, the Watson JavaScript programs of Figures 8.4 and 8.5 will always produce the same output each time they are run.
			</p>

			<p>
				Most programs of lasting value, however, generate different results, or outputs, depending on the inputs they are given. The primary reason that WGL programs always produce the same result each time they are run is that the language lacks an input statement. Watson JavaScript does not suffer from this limitation. It provides two input instructions – one for reading in text data, and one for reading in numeric data.
			</p>

			<p>
				The general format of the text input statement is:
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				<span class="Italicized">variable</span><span class="Subfigure">= prompt(</span><span class="Italicized">message</span><span class="Subfigure">,</span><span class="Italicized">defaultValue</span><span class="Subfigure">);</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				In this statement, <span class="Italicized">variable</span> will be replaced with an actual program variable that has been declared to be of type “Text”. This variable will hold the data entered by the user. The <span class="Italicized">message</span> field will be replaced by a text string that contains a brief message designed to prompt the user to enter the appropriate value. The <span class="Italicized">defaultValue</span> field is used to specify a default text string that will be assigned to the variable in case the user fails to enter any data when prompted to do so.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thus, the text input statement:
			</p>

			<p class="P47">
				firstName = prompt("Please enter your first name.", "unknown");
			</p>

			<p>
				will prompt the user to enter his or her first name by displaying an input dialog box on the screen with the prompt “Please enter your first name.” next to the input field. Whatever characters the user types in will be stored in the variable <span class="Subfigure">firstName</span>. If the user simply dismisses the input dialog without entering any characters, <span class="Subfigure">firstName</span> will be assigned the text string “unknown” in order to indicate that the user’s first name is unknown.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Watson JavaScript numeric input statement is similar. It has the form:
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				<span class="Italicized">variable</span><span class="Subfigure">=</span><span class="Subfigure">parseFloat(</span><span class="Subfigure">prompt(</span><span class="T43">message</span><span class="Subfigure">,</span><span class="T43">defaultValue</span><span class="Subfigure">)</span><span class="Subfigure">)</span><span class="Subfigure">;</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				The most obvious difference between Watson JavaScript’s text input statement and its numeric input statement is that the numeric input statements include the phrase “parseFloat()”. This phrase insures that Watson JavaScript will supply a numeric entry pad to the end user so that only numeric data can be entered. In addition, this statement requires that <span class="Italicized">variable</span> be replaced with a program variable declared to be of type “numeric”. Also, while the <span class="Italicized">message</span> will continue to be a text string, the <span class="Italicized">defaultValue</span> must be a numeric constant – rather than a text constant.
			</p>

			<p>
				The numeric input statement
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Subfigure">age</span><span class="Subfigure">=</span><span class="Subfigure">parseFloat(</span><span class="Subfigure">prompt</span><span class="Subfigure">(</span><span class="Subfigure">“Enter your age.”</span><span class="Subfigure">,</span><span class="Subfigure">0</span><span class="Subfigure">)</span><span class="Subfigure">)</span><span class="Subfigure">;</span>
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				will prompt the user to enter his or her age by displaying a numeric entry pad on the screen with the prompt “Enter your age.” next to the input field. The number entered by the user will be stored in the variable <span class="Subfigure">age</span>. If the user fails to enter a number, zero will be assigned to age as a default value.
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.6 illustrates the versatility of programs that make use of input statements. The program asks a user to enter his or her name. Next, it stores the characters entered by the user into a text variable called <span class="Subfigure">firstName</span>. The program then prints a greeting using the contents of <span class="Subfigure">firstName</span> along with some additional text strings.
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Looking at Figure 8.6 more closely, we see that the first thing this program does is to declare a text variable called <span class="Subfigure">firstName</span>. Next, a text input statement is executed which will prompt the user to enter his or her name, and store the text string entered by that user into the variable <span class="Subfigure">firstName</span>. If the user dismisses the input dialog without entering any text, the default value, an empty string “”, will be stored in <span class="Subfigure">firstName</span>.

				Figure 8.6: &nbsp; A program that illustrates both input and output of text
			</p>

			<p>
				It should be noted that while the input dialog box is displayed, the Watson JavaScript program is on “hold”. There is no set time limit on how long the program will wait for the user to enter his or her input. The program will “wake up” and continue with its execution when the user dismisses the input dialog window.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is also important to recognize that the user is free to enter any sequence of characters he or she desires. However, since the message displayed on the screen asks for the user’s first name, that is what he or she will most likely enter – assuming the user is being cooperative and is capable of reading and understanding the input prompt. In Figure 8.6 the text string “Mike” was entered by the user and thus stored in <span class="Subfigure">firstName</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, the statement &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">document.write(“Hello ”);</span> &nbsp; prints
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				<span class="Subfigure">Hello</span> _
			</p>

			<p>
				on the screen. Since the statement is a “write”, as opposed to a “writeln”, the print position will remain on the same line as the string and be placed immediately following the last character of that string – a blank.

				The next statement &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">document.write(firstName);</span> &nbsp; will print the current contents of <span class="Subfigure">firstName</span> on the screen. Since this variable contains the text string “Mike”, those character are printed giving the following output
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				<span class="Subfigure">Hello Mike</span>_
			</p>

			<p>
				Note that the print position immediately follows the final character of the text string: “e”.
			</p>

			<p>
				The last statement of the program:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				document.writeln(“. Nice to meet you.”);
			</p>

			<p>
				causes the output to become:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				Hello Mike. Nice to meet you.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  _
			</p>

			<p>
				Since this statement is a “writeln”, it moves the print position to the next line of output. The program then terminates.
			</p>

			<p>
				What we have just done is to walk, or trace, through a single run of the program of Figure 8.6. During this trace we assumed the user entered “Mike” at the input prompt. The power of input statements is that they allow programs to produce different outputs based on the inputs they are given. Thus, if the user had entered “Irene” instead of “Mike”, the program would have printed:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				Hello Irene. Nice to meet you.
			</p>

			<p>
				The flexibility and power that input statements give programming languages cannot be overstated. Without them the only way to get a program to change its output would be to modify the program code itself – something your typical user cannot be expected to do.
			</p>

			<p>
				General-purpose programming languages, such as Watson JavaScript, allow human programmers to construct programs that do amazing things. When attempting to understand what a program does, however, it is vitally important that you always keep in mind that the computer does not comprehend the meaning of the character strings it manipulates or the significance of the calculations it performs.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the program of Figure 8.6 is simply displaying strings of characters, storing user input, and echoing that input back to the screen along with some additional character strings. The computer has no clue what the text string “Please enter your first name.” means. For all it cares the string could have been “My hovercraft is full of eels.” or “qwerty uiop asdf ghjkl;” or any other text string for that matter. Its only concern is to copy the characters of the text string onto the display screen.
			</p>

			<p>
				Only in the minds of human beings do the sequence of characters “Please enter your first name.” take on meaning. If this seems odd, try to remember that comprehension does not even occur in the minds of all humans, only those who are capable of reading and understanding written English. A four year old, for example, would not know how to respond to this prompt because he or she would be unable to read it. This is so despite the fact that if you were to ask the child his or her name, he or she could immediately respond and perhaps even type it out on the keyboard for you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.7 contains another program that demonstrates input and output. Unlike the program of Figure 8.6, which dealt with the input and output of text strings, this program illustrates the process on integers. The program begins by declaring two integer variables, one called <span class="Subfigure">firstNum</span> and the other called <span class="Subfigure">secondNum</span>. The program then prompts the user to enter a number. The input is captured and stored in <span class="Subfigure">firstNum</span>. Next, the program prompts the user for another number and stores whatever the user enters in the variable <span class="Subfigure">secondNum</span>. Finally, these numbers and their sum are printed – surrounded by appropriate character strings to form a meaningful sentence. A sample run of the program, on the numbers 15 and 10, is given in Figure 8.7 along with the actual program code.
			</p>

			<p>
				You may be wondering what would happen if the user running this program were to enter a sequence of characters that did not form a valid number. For example, say the user attempted enter “cow” or “chicken” which are text strings, or even $37, which is not a valid number since it contains the special symbol “$”. If the system attempted to store these inputs into a numeric variable an error would result.

				The Watson JavaScript Lab has safeguards to prevent such errors from occurring. Input is only accepted from on-screen pop-up input dialogs. When a numeric value is to be read, the input dialog provides a numeric input pad for that purpose. Thus, the lab prevents the user from entering text when a number is required, since it is impossible to enter characters through the numeric entry pad. When a text string is to be read, the input dialog provides a type-in box.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the “real world”, the safeguards of the Watson JavaScript Lab are often absent, so programmers must create robust programs that examine user input in order to verify that it is of the proper type, before processing that input. If the input is found to be in error, the program must take appropriate corrective action, such as rejecting the invalid input and requesting the user try again.

			<p class="Section">
				8.5 &nbsp; Expressions and assignment
			</p>

			<p>
				As we have just seen, the “prompt” statements can be used to store user input into a variable. The “prompt” statements are really just specialized versions of the more general “assignment” statement.  &nbsp; Assignments take the form:
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				<span class="Italicized">variable </span><span class="Subfigure">=</span> <span class="Italicized">expression</span><span class="Subfigure">;</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				The symbol “=” is called the assignment operator. It is related to, but unique from the mathematical “equals” operator. Assignment statements work by first evaluating the expression on the right hand side of the assignment operator to determine its value. Once that value has been computed, the value is then stored in the variable named on the left hand side of the assignment operator.
			</p>

			<p>
				Watson JavaScript supports two major types of expressions: text string-valued expressions and numeric-valued expressions. Since the variable named on the left hand side of the assignment statement specifies where the value of the right hand side expression is to be stored, it is important that their types match. In other words, if a numeric variable is named on the left hand side of the assignment operator, then a numeric-valued expression must occur on the right hand side of the operator. Similarly, if a text string-valued expression occurs on the right hand side of the assignment operator, then a text variable must be named on the left hand side. The following are valid assignment statements, assuming <span class="Subfigure">firstName</span> is a text variable, and <span class="Subfigure">total</span> and <span class="Subfigure">age</span> are numeric variables.
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				firstName = “Chris”;&nbsp; &nbsp; total = 0;&nbsp; &nbsp; age = 41;
			</p>

			<p>
				The numeric expressions supported by Watson JavaScript are very similar to the spreadsheet formulas presented in Section 2.4.2 of Chapter 2. Watson JavaScript numeric expressions support the same math operators as do spreadsheet formulas; namely, addition “+”, subtraction “-”, multiplication “*”, and division “/”. The precedence of these operators remains the same, with multiplication and division being performed ahead of addition and subtraction. Parentheses for grouping sub-expressions are used identically in both systems.
			</p>

			<p>
				The major difference between spreadsheet formulas and Watson JavaScript expressions are that Watson JavaScript expression use variable names in place of cell references.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thus, assuming <span class="Subfigure">X</span> and <span class="Subfigure">Y</span> are numeric variables,
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				Y + Z

				will be evaluated as the sum of the value stored in <span class="Subfigure">Y</span> together with the value stored in <span class="Subfigure">Z</span>. Assuming that <span class="Subfigure">Y</span> holds the value 15 and <span class="Subfigure">Z</span> holds the value 10, the expression would evaluate to 25. If this expression appeared in an assignment statement such as
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				X = Y + Z;
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				which is read “<span class="Subfigure">X</span> is assigned the value of <span class="Subfigure">Y</span> plus <span class="Subfigure">Z</span>”, <span class="Subfigure">X</span> would take on the value 25. Of course, if <span class="Subfigure">Y</span> and <span class="Subfigure">Z</span> held different values, such as 100 and 250, then the value stored in <span class="Subfigure">X</span> would be different as well, 350 in this case.
			</p>

			<p>
				The priorities, or precedence, of the various Watson JavaScript mathematical operators are summarized in Figure 8.8. This figure is almost identical to Figure 2.5, which contains the priorities for spreadsheet formulas.
			</p>

			<p>
				When evaluating expressions, the general rule is that all operations at the same “level” are performed one after another working through the expression from left to right. Evaluation continues in this manner until a single result is computed.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the expression:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				Z + Y / 3 * 8
			</p>

			<p>
				Where <span class="Subfigure">Y</span> is again 15 and <span class="Subfigure">Z</span> is 10, would be evaluated in the following way. First, <span class="Subfigure">Z</span> would be replaced with 10 and then <span class="Subfigure">Y</span> with 15, giving the intermediate expression:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				10 + 15 / 3 * 8
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				There are now three operations that need to be performed to compute the result: one addition, one division, and one multiplication. Since multiplication and division are at a higher precedence level than addition and subtraction, the division of 15 by 3 is performed, resulting in:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				10 + 5 * 8
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, the multiplication 5 by 8 is performed, giving:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				10 + 40
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, the addition takes place, producing the result:
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				50
			</p>

			<p>
				Assuming the expression had occurred in the statement
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				document.writeln(Z + Y / 3 * 8);
			</p>

			<p>
				the value 50 would have been output to the display.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to numbers, Watson JavaScript also provides limited support for text strings. As we have seen, text strings may be represented as both constants and variables. They can be written to the display screen (via “write” and “writeln”), read from the keyboard (via “prompt”), and assigned to variables (via assignment statements).
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the following:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				president = “George Bush”;
			</p>

			<p>
				is a perfectly valid assignment statement, as long as <span class="Subfigure">president</span> is a text variable. When executed this statement will place the value of the text string “George Bush” into the text variable <span class="Subfigure">president</span>. Likewise,
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				commanderInChief = president;
			</p>

			<p>
				is valid as well, assuming both <span class="Subfigure">commanderInChief</span> and &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">president</span> are text variables. The statement places a copy of the current value held in <span class="Subfigure">president</span> into the variable <span class="Subfigure">commanderInChief</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Watson JavaScript includes one built in operation that may be performed on text strings. This operator, called concatenation, allows two separate strings to be merged together. In a sense, concatenation is the text string equivalent of the mathematical operator addition. For this reason, the JavaScript symbol for concatenation is “+”.
			</p>

			<p>
				Whenever a “+” symbol is encountered in an expression, JavaScript determines its meaning by looking at the type of the variables and constants appearing in that expression. If these variables and constants are numeric, then JavaScript interprets “+” as addition. If the variables and constants of the expression are text-based, then JavaScript interprets “+” as concatenation.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the following is a legal assignment statement, assuming president is a <span class="Subfigure">text</span> variable.
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				president = “George ” + “Bush”;
			</p>

			<p>
				This statement would first evaluate the text expression &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">“George ” + “Busch”</span> which generates the text string “George Bush”, and then assign that value to the text variable <span class="Subfigure">president</span>. Note that in order for this statement to have meaning in Watson JavaScript, <span class="Subfigure">president</span> must be a text variable and not a numeric variable. Also note that a space was included at the end of the first text string, “George ”. This was necessary so that when this string was concatenated with “Bush” a blank would appear between the first and last name.

In order to create programs capable of solving more complex tasks we need to examine how the basic instructions we have studied can be organized into higher-level constructs.

				The vast majority of imperative programming languages support three types of control constructs which are used to group individual statements together and specify the conditions under which they will be executed. These control constructs are: sequence, selection, and repetition.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Bolded">Sequence</span> requires that the individual statements of a program be executed one after another, in the order that they appear in the program. Sequence is defined implicitly by the physical order of the statements. It does not require an explicit program structure.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Bolded">Selection</span> constructs contain one or more blocks of statements and specify the conditions under which the blocks should be executed. Basically, selection allows a human programmer to include within a program one or more blocks of “optional” code along with some tests that the program can use to determine which one of the blocks to perform. Selection allows imperative programs to choose which particular set of actions to perform, based on the conditions that exist at the time the construct is encountered during program execution.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Bolded">Repetition</span> constructs contain exactly one block of statements together with a mechanism for repeating the statements within the block some number of times. There are two major types of repetition: iteration and recursion. <span class="Bolded">Iteration</span>, which is usually implemented directly in a programming language as an explicit program structure, often involves repeating a block of statements either (1) while some condition is true or (2) some fixed number of times. <span class="Bolded">Recursion</span> involves a subprogram (e.g., a function) that makes reference to itself. As with sequence, recursion does not normally have an explicit program construct associated with it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sequence, selection, and repetition are discussed at length below; so don’t worry if their behavior and purpose are not yet 100% clear to you. At this point all you really need to understand is the basic idea behind each of the control constructs – that sequence involves performing statements one after another; selection involves choosing which group of statements to perform based on a test; and repetition involves performing a group of statements over and over.

				The idea of sequence is illustrated graphically in Figure 8.9. This figure shows the order in which the statements of the program of Figure 8.6 would be executed.

			<p>
				Sequence is the most basic control construct. It is the “glue” that holds the individual statements of a program together. Yet, when students who are new to programming try to understand how a particular program works, they often just glance over the various statements making up the program to get a “feel” for what it does, rather than methodically tracing through the sequence of actions it performs. One reason such an approach is tempting is because students tend to believe they can figure out what a program is “supposed” to do based on contextual clues such as the meaning of variable names and character strings. After all, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that the program of Figure 8.4 prints “Hello world!”.

				Figure 8.10: &nbsp; A program and variable trace designed to illustrate the concept of sequence
			</p>

			<p>
				While it is often possible to gain a superficial knowledge of a program simply by reading it, this approach will not give you the kind of detailed understanding that is frequently required to accurately predict a program’s output. Being able to carefully trace through a program to determine exactly what it does is an important skill. Failure to carefully follow the sequence of instructions often leads to confusion when trying to understand the behavior of a program.<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: And incorrect answers on exams, I might add."><a href="#ftn4" id="body_ftn4">4</a></span></span>
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.10 illustrates the importance of sequence. It contains a little “do nothing” program that prints the value 16 on the display screen. What makes this program interesting is not so much what its output is, as the way in which that output is computed. Without carefully tracing through the program, one statement at a time, it would be difficult to correctly predict the final output generated by the program.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first three lines of the program define the numeric variables <span class="Subfigure">x</span>, <span class="Subfigure">y</span>, and <span class="Subfigure">z</span>. In Figure 8.10 the state of the program’s memory after executing each line of code is given beside that statement. After performing the first declaration, the program knows only about the number <span class="Subfigure">x</span>. After the second declaration, it knows of <span class="Subfigure">x</span> and <span class="Subfigure">y</span>, and after the third, <span class="Subfigure">x</span>, <span class="Subfigure">y</span>, and <span class="Subfigure">z</span>. Since these variables have not yet been assigned values, their values are considered to be undefined at this point.
			</p>

			<p>
				The next instruction &nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				x = 5;
			</p>

			<p>
				places the value 5 into the variable <span class="Subfigure">x</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice at this point that the values of <span class="Subfigure">y</span> and <span class="Subfigure">z</span> are still undefined.  &nbsp; The next statement:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				x = x + 1;
			</p>

			<p>
				will place a 6 into <span class="Subfigure">x</span>. It works in the following way. First, the expression
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				x + 1
			</p>

			<p>
				is evaluated. Since the value of <span class="Subfigure">x</span> is 5 at this point, the expression is equivalent to 5 + 1 which, of course, evaluates to 6. Now that the value of the right hand expression has been computed, that value can be assigned to the variable on the left hand side of the assignment operator, <span class="Subfigure">x</span>. Hence, the current value of <span class="Subfigure">x</span>, which was 5, is replaced by 6.
			</p>

			<p>
				The next instruction:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				y = 3;
			</p>

			<p>
				places a value of 3 into <span class="Subfigure">y</span>, leaving only <span class="Subfigure">z</span> without a value. This situation is rectified by the next statement:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				z = x + y;
			</p>

			<p>
				which stores a 9 into <span class="Subfigure">z</span>. The expression
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				x + y
			</p>

			<p>
				generates this value due to the fact that when it is evaluated <span class="Subfigure">x</span> has a value of 6 and <span class="Subfigure">y</span> has a value of 3, giving 6 + 3 or 9.
			</p>

			<p>
				The next instruction to be executed:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				y = y - 2;
			</p>

			<p>
				has the effect of subtracting 2 from the current value of <span class="Subfigure">y</span>, which was 3, giving 1. Note that this statement has no effect on the values stored in <span class="Subfigure">x</span> or <span class="Subfigure">z</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The final statement of the program:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				document.writeln(x+y+z);
			</p>

			<p>
				will print the value 16 on the display screen. That value is computed in the following way:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				x + y + z
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				6 + 1 + 9
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">

				8.6.2 &nbsp; Selection
			</p>

			<p>
				Selection statements give imperative languages the ability to make choices based on the results of certain condition tests. These condition tests take the form of <span class="Bolded">Boolean expressions</span>, which are expressions that evaluate to either <span class="Italicized">true</span> or <span class="Italicized">false</span>.<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: Boolean expressions are named for the mathematician George Boole. Hence, the word “Boolean” should always be capitalized."><a href="#ftn5" id="body_ftn5">5</a></span></span> &nbsp; There are various types of Boolean expressions, but the types supported in Watson JavaScript are based on relational operators. <span class="Bolded">Relational operators</span> compare two expressions of like type to determine whether their values satisfy some criterion. The general form of all Boolean expressions supported in Watson JavaScript is:
			</p>

			<p class="P35">
				expression &nbsp;  relational_operator &nbsp;  expression
			</p>

			<p>
				Watson JavaScript includes six relational operators for comparing numeric-valued expressions. They are:
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="T20">&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span><span class="T19">&gt;</span> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  meaning &nbsp;  “greater than”&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <span class="T19">&ge;</span> &nbsp;  meaning &nbsp;  “greater than or equal to”
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="T20">&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span><span class="T19">&lt;</span> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  meaning &nbsp;  “less than”&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <span class="T19">&le;</span> &nbsp;  meaning &nbsp;  “less than or equal to”
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="T20">&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span><span class="T19">==</span> &nbsp;  meaning &nbsp;  “equal to”&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <span class="T19">!=</span> &nbsp;  meaning &nbsp;  “not equal to”
			</p>

			<p>
				So, for example, when <span class="Subfigure">x</span> is 15 and <span class="Subfigure">y</span> is 25 the expression &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">x &gt; y</span> evaluates to <span class="Italicized">false</span>, since 15 is not greater than 25.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is vitally important that you not confuse the relational operator “<span class="Subfigure">==</span>” with the assignment operator “<span class="Subfigure">=</span>” – though they look similar, they do very different things. Assignment places a value into a variable, thus “<span class="Subfigure">x = 15;</span>” <span class="Italicized">assigns</span> the value 15 to the variable <span class="Subfigure">x</span>, regardless of the value originally stored in <span class="Subfigure">x</span>. On the other hand, “<span class="Subfigure">x == 15</span>” <span class="Italicized">compares</span> the current value stored in variable <span class="Subfigure">x</span> to the number 15. If these two values are equal the expression returns <span class="Italicized">true</span>, otherwise it returns <span class="Italicized">false</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here are some additional examples of Boolean expressions that use the numeric-based relational operators. These examples assume that the variable <span class="Subfigure">x</span> holds 15 and <span class="Subfigure">y</span> holds 25.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">x != y - 10 &nbsp; </span><span class="Italicized">false</span> &nbsp;  &nbsp; Substituting for <span class="Subfigure">x</span> &amp; <span class="Subfigure">y</span> gives &nbsp; 15 != 25-10 &nbsp; which is false.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">x &gt; y - 20 &nbsp; </span><span class="Italicized">true</span> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Substituting for <span class="Subfigure">x</span> &amp; <span class="Subfigure">y</span> gives &nbsp; 15 &gt; 25-20 &nbsp; which is true.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">x + 10 == y &nbsp; </span><span class="Italicized">true</span> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Substituting for <span class="Subfigure">x</span> &amp; <span class="Subfigure">y</span> gives &nbsp; 15+10 <span class="Subfigure">==</span> 25 &nbsp; which is true.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">x == x + 1 &nbsp; </span><span class="Italicized">false</span> &nbsp;  &nbsp; Substituting for <span class="Subfigure">x</span> gives &nbsp; 15 <span class="Subfigure">==</span> 15+1 &nbsp; which is false.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that the last expression always evaluates to <span class="Italicized">false</span>, regardless of the value of <span class="Subfigure">x</span>. This is because there is no possible value for <span class="Subfigure">x</span> that will be equal to that value plus one. Another point illustrated by these examples is that relational operators have a lower precedence than mathematical operators. During expression evaluation, all multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction operations are performed before any relational operations.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to the six relational operators for mathematical expressions, there are four relational operators defined on string expressions. These operators are:
			</p>

			<p class="P101">
				<span class="Subfigure">==</span> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  meaning “is identical to”&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">!=</span>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  meaning “is not identical to”
			</p>

			<p class="P101">
				<span class="Subfigure">&lt;</span> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  meaning “precedes”&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">&gt;</span>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  meaning “follows”
			</p>

			<p>
				The relational expression:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				favoriteShow == “X-Files”;
			</p>

			<p>
				will be <span class="Italicized">true</span> if <span class="Subfigure">favoriteShow</span> is a text variable that currently contains the sequence of characters “X-files”. If the variable contains any other sequence of characters, the expression will be <span class="Italicized">false</span>. It is important to note that text string comparisons are “case sensitive”. This means that upper and lower case letters are considered to be separate characters for comparison purposes. If <span class="Subfigure">favoriteShow</span> contains the string “x-files” with a lower case “x”, the above expression would evaluate to <span class="Italicized">false</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				In general, comparisons are based on lexicographic, or dictionary, order. So, &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">x &gt; y</span> &nbsp; when <span class="Subfigure">x</span> is “Fox” and <span class="Subfigure">y</span> is “Dana” evaluates to <span class="Italicized">true</span>, since “Fox” follows “Dana” using dictionary order. However, if <span class="Subfigure">x</span> were assigned the value “Cancer Man”, then the same expression would evaluate to <span class="Italicized">false</span> since the “C” in “Cancer Man” would not follow the “D” in “Dana”. You should always keep in mind that string comparison operators are case sensitive – the rule being that upper case letters precede lower case letters. Thus, the expression
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				“Fox” &lt; “alien life form”
			</p>

			<p>
				evaluates to <span class="Italicized">true</span>, since capital “F” precedes lower case “a”.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here are some additional examples of Boolean expressions that use the string-based relational operators. These examples assume that the variable <span class="Subfigure">A</span> holds “UFO” and <span class="Subfigure">B</span> holds “FBI”.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">A &lt; B</span> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="Italicized">false</span>. The value of <span class="Subfigure">A</span>, “UFO”, does not precede the value of <span class="Subfigure">B</span>, “FBI”.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="T15">“</span><span class="Subfigure">A” &lt; “B”</span> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <span class="Italicized">true</span>.  The string “A” does precede the string “B” in dictionary order.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="T15">&nbsp; </span><span class="Subfigure">A != “FBI”</span> &nbsp; <span class="Italicized">true</span>.  The value of <span class="Subfigure">A</span>, “UFO”, is not identical to the string “FBI”.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="T15">&nbsp; </span><span class="Subfigure">B == “FBI”</span><span class="Italicized">true</span>.  The value of B, “FBI”, is identical to the string “FBI”.
			</p>

			<p>
				Selection statements use the results of Boolean expressions to choose which sequence of actions to perform next. Watson JavaScript supports two different selection statements: If-Else and If. Each is described below.

			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 8.12 presents a program that uses an If-Else statement to determine whether a person is of legal drinking age (in the US). The program prompts a user to enter his or her age and then stores whatever the user inputs into a variable called <span class="Subfigure">age</span>. This variable is then tested against the constant 21. If <span class="Subfigure">age</span> is less than 21, the text string “No beer for you.” is displayed. Otherwise, if <span class="Subfigure">age</span> is greater than or equal to 21, the text string “Here, have a cold one!” is displayed.
			</p>

			<p>
				If-Else statements always choose one code block or the other based on the value of the Boolean expression. If the condition is true, the first code block, sometimes called the “then” block, is executed and the second code block is skipped. If the condition is false, the first code block is skipped and the second code block, sometimes called the “else” block, is executed. Under no circumstances will <span class="Ital">both</span> statements blocks be executed.
			</p>

			<p>
				While only one statement occurs in the “then” and “else” blocks of the program of Figure 8.12, If-Else structures in general allow multiple statements per block. The program of Figure 8.13 illustrates multi-statement “then” and “else” blocks. The purpose of the program is to compute the absolute value of an input number. The program begins by requesting input from the user and storing that input in the variable <span class="Subfigure">num</span>. The phrase “The absolute value of the ” is then displayed on the screen. Next, <span class="Subfigure">num</span> is tested to determine whether its value is less than zero. If it is, the sequence of “write” statements in the “then” block generates a message of the form:
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">

			<p class="P60">

				where <span class="Subfigure">&lt;num&gt;</span> is replaced with the value of the input number and <span class="Subfigure">&lt;abs&gt;</span> is replaced with a positive version of the input number. Otherwise, the “else” block generates a message of the form:

			<p>
				Finally, following the If-Else construct, a “writeln” statement prints a period. Note that since this statement occurs after the end of the If-Else block, the period will always be printed, regardless of whether the “then” block or the “else” block was executed.
			</p>

			<p>
				The fact that If-Else statements allow other statements to be embedded within them raises an interesting question: &nbsp; “Can an If-Else statement occur within the “then” or “else” block of another If-Else statement?” &nbsp; The answer to this question is “sure”. In fact, these “nested” If-Else structures are common in all but the simplest programs.
			</p>

			<p>
				The idea of nested If-Else statements is illustrated in Figure 8.14. This program determines whether or not a person is classified as a “baller” based on their age and income. For the purposes of this example, a baller is defined as someone under 25 years of age with an income of $50,000 or more per year. Because this definition depends on two condition tests, age and income, an If-Else statement for testing one of them must be embedded in an If-Else statement to test the other.

			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The program begins by gathering the <span class="Subfigure">age</span> and <span class="Subfigure">income</span> of the user. The value of <span class="Subfigure">age</span> is tested to determine if the user is less than 25 years old.  If so, the “then” statement block is executed. This block consists of a single If-Else statement that determines whether <span class="Subfigure">income</span> is $50K or more. If so, the message “You’re a baller.” is displayed, since the user is both under 25 and makes $50K or more per year. If the condition involving <span class="Subfigure">income</span> is false, the message “You’re too poor to be a baller.” is displayed. This makes sense, because the user is young enough (under 25) to be a baller, but he or she lacks the necessary “bling”.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Returning to the outer If-Else, if the user is 25 or older, he or she cannot be a baller.<span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: Note: Our definition is equal opportunity – both men and women can be ballers."><a href="#ftn6" id="body_ftn6">6</a></span></span> &nbsp; Rather than just telling the user that he or she is too old, the program goes ahead and tests the income level anyway. If the user makes $50K or more per year, then he or she would be a baller if only they were younger. Hence the message displayed in this case is “You’re too old to be a baller.” &nbsp; However, if the income level is below $50K then the user is both too old and too poor. These deficiencies are pointed out in the final message.
			</p

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Note that following the “}” of the outer If-Else a “writeln” statement occurs. This statement will print “Later…” regardless of which of the four “baller diagnostic messages” were reported.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				You should now have a pretty good idea how the If-Else statement works. Before leaving the topic of selection, however, we should talk about the other selection statement supported by JavaScript – the “If” statement.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The If statement is similar to If-Else statement except it does not include an “else” block. The general form of the If statement is:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="P87">
				<span class="Subfigure">if (</span><span class="Italicized">Boolean expression</span><span class="Subfigure">)</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				{
			</p>

			<p class="P101">

			</p>

			<p>
				}
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				As you probably suspect, if the Boolean expression is true, the statements in the code block enclosed in braces are executed. Otherwise, they are skipped. Program control returns to a single path at the end of the block, so the statement following the “}” will always be executed regardless of the results of the Boolean Expression. The behavior of the If construct is graphically illustrated in Figure 8.15.

				If statements are generally used by programmers to allow their programs to detect and handle conditions that require “special” or “additional” processing. This is in contrast to If-Else statements, which can be viewed as selecting between two “equal” choices.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The program of Figure 8.16 illustrates the use of an If statement. The purpose of the program is to report whether a user is or is not a minor based on his or her age. The program begins by prompting the user to enter his or her age. The input is then stored in the variable <span class="Subfigure">age</span>. Next, the text string “You are ” is displayed. An If statement then checks to see whether <span class="Subfigure">age</span> is greater than or equal to 18. If the condition is true, the word “not ” is printed. Finally, the phrase “a minor.” is displayed. Thus, this program prints either: “You are not a minor.” or “You are a minor.” depending on the value of <span class="Subfigure">age</span>.

				8.6.3 &nbsp; Repetition
			</p>

			<p>
				Repetition is the name given to the class of control constructs that allow computer programs to repeat a task over and over. You should already have some familiarity with this concept from your study of the Watson Graphics Language (WGL), since WGL includes a repetition construct of the form:
			</p>

			<p class="P119">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="P118">
				<span class="Subfigure">Repeat</span><span class="Italicized">counter <span class="Subfigure">times
			</p>

			<p class="P119">
				Loop
			</p>

			<p class="P118">
				<span class="T15">&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span><span class="Italicized">statements
			</p>

			<p class="P119">
				EndLoop
			</p>

			<p>
				In these WGL “repeat” loops,</span> <span class="Italicized">counter</span> is a positive integer constant in the range 1 to 99 that specifies the number of times the</span> <span class="Italicized">statements</span> are to be executed. Recall that using this simple looping construct we created drawings and animations, and explored the idea of solving problems by decomposing them into repeatable “generic” steps.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although not really touched on in the graphics chapter, there are two primary forms of repetition. These are known as iteration and recursion. For the moment, we will concentrate on iteration and defer discussion of recursion until Section 8.8.
			</p>

			<p>
				Watson JavaScript supports iteration with two separate constructs: the “while” loop and the “for” loop. “While” loops are referred to as “condition-based” loops since they continue to execute the statements of the loop while its condition remains true. “For” loops are “count-based”. The “For” loops are known as a “count-based” loops because the number of times the loop statements execute is based on the value of a “loop variable” that is incremented each time through the loop. We will first look at the “while” loop and then proceed to the “for” loop.
			</p>

			<p>
				The general format of the “While” loop is:
			</p>

			<p class="Footnote">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="T13">while (</span><span class="T7">variable</span><span class="T7">&nbsp; relationalOperator</span><span class="T7">&nbsp; finalValue</span><span class="T13">)
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="T13">{
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="T3">&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; </span><span class="T7">statements&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp; </span> }
			</p>

			<p class="Footnote">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				“While” loops work by first evaluating their</span> <span class="Italicized">Boolean_expression</span>. If the value of the expression is false, program control immediately moves to the first statement following the closing bracket: &nbsp; “}”. In this case the</span> <span class="Italicized">statements</span> in the loop body are skipped entirely. If, on the other hand, the expression evaluates to true, then the sequence of</span> <span class="Italicized">statements</span> in the loop body is executed once. After performing the</span> <span class="Italicized">statements</span>, control returns to the top of the loop where the</span> <span class="Italicized">Boolean_expression</span> is once again evaluated. If the expression is still true, the</span> <span class="Italicized">statements</span> of the loop are executed a second time. Otherwise, execution of the loop terminates and control passes to the statement following “}”. This process repeats itself until the</span> <span class="Italicized">Boolean_expression</span> eventually becomes false and the loop exits.

				Figure 8.17: An illustration of the behavior of the “while” loop iteration construct
			</p>

			<p>
				The behavior of the “while” loop is illustrated graphically in Figure 8.17.
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.18 contains a program that uses a “while” loop. The purpose of the program is to compute the sum of a collection of non-negative numbers to be entered by the user. The program will repeatedly ask the user to enter a number, adding each number to the total, and printing the total so far. When the user enters a –1 the program will print the final total and exit.
			</p>

			<p>
				This program includes two variables: <span class="Subfigure">total</span>, which will hold the sum of the numbers, and <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span>, which will hold the input entered by the user. Execution begins by setting <span class="Subfigure">total</span> to zero. Next, the user is prompted to “Enter a positive number (or –1 to quit)”. The user’s response is stored in <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span>. In the run of the program illustrated in Figure 8.18, the user entered 100.
			</p>

			<p>
				At this point the program encounters the “while” loop, and the value that was entered by the user is compared to 0. If this value is greater than or equal to 0 the statements that form the body of the loop will be executed, if the value is less than 0 the loop will exit. Given 100 as the value of <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span>, the loop statements are executed.

			<p>
				First, <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span> is added to <span class="Subfigure">total</span>. Next, the message “The total so far is… 100” is displayed. This is followed by the prompt “Enter a positive number (or –1 to quit)”. The</span> user’s response to this prompt, which is 50 in the example run of Figure 8.18, is stored into <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span> and control returns to the top of the loop.
			</p>

			<p>
				The value of the variable <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span> is once again compared to 0. Since <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span> contains a 50, which is greater than or equal to 0, execution of the loop continues. The 50 is added to <span class="Subfigure">total</span>. The message “The total so far is… 150” is displayed, and the next input prompt generated.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the run of the program shown in Figure 8.18 the user enters a –1 at this point. The user’s input is stored into <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span> and control again returns to the top of the loop. Since the Boolean expression, “</span><span class="Subfigure">newValue &ge; 0</span>”, would now evaluate to false, execution of the loop terminates and control moves to the “write” and “writeln” statements following the loop. These statements report the final total of 150, and program execution halts.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is interesting to note that although the program instructs users to enter “–1 to quit”, the condition that controls the loop is actually “</span><span class="Subfigure">newValue &ge; 0</span>” which will be false for any negative number. Thus, the loop will actually terminate whenever the user enters any number less than zero, such as –5.
			</p>

			<p>
				While the program of Figure 8.18 works well for computing the total of a collection of non-negative numbers, it suffers from the limitation that it does not work for all numbers: positive, negative, and zero. The reason for this limitation is that the program depends on a ‘sentinel’, in this case a negative number, to determine when the main loop should be terminated – and therefore when the program should stop asking for additional numbers and report the final total.

				Figure 8.19: &nbsp; A program to compute the sum of N numbers using a “while” loop
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				One way around this issue, is to modify the program of Figure 8.18 so that it first asks the user how many numbers are to be added together, and then uses that number to control how many times the main loop is to repeated. Such a program, which computes the sum of N numbers (positive, negative, or zero) using a “while” loop is given in Figure 8.19.
			</p>

			<p>
				In many ways, the programs of Figure 8.18 and 8.19 are quite similar. They use the variables <span class="Subfigure">total</span> and <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span> in the same way. They both prompt the user to enter numbers each time through the loop, print running totals, and a final total at the end. However, there are significant differences between these two programs as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				The program of Figure 8.19 contains four variables: <span class="Subfigure">n</span>, <span class="Subfigure">total</span>, <span class="Subfigure">counter</span>, and <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span>. The variable <span class="Subfigure">n</span> is used to hold the number of values to be summed. </span><span class="Subfigure">total</span> holds the sum of the numbers that have been added together so far. </span><span class="Subfigure">counter</span> is the loop variable – it keeps up with which iteration of the loop is currently being executed. Finally, <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span> is used to receive each number entered by the user.
			</p>

			<p>
				After declaring the variables, the program begins execution by prompting the user for the number of values to be summed. The user’s input is captured and stored in the variable <span class="Subfigure">n</span>. In the sample run of the program given in Figure 8.19, the user entered 2 at this point – indicating that two numbers are to be summed. Next, the variable <span class="Subfigure">total</span> is set equal to 0. This is done to reflect the fact that, at the moment, the total of all of the numbers the program has added together is zero.
			</p>

			<p>
				The program now prepares itself to enter the main loop, which will control the prompting of input and addition of numbers. During this portion of the program, the variable <span class="Subfigure">counter</span> will mark how many times the loop has been executed, while the variable <span class="Subfigure">n</span> keeps up with the total number of times we desire the loop to be executed.
			</p>

			<p>
				The variable <span class="Subfigure">counter</span> is now set to 1. This action is taken to record the fact that the program is about to enter the main loop for the first time. The program now encounters the “while” loop. The variable <span class="Subfigure">counter</span> is compared to <span class="Subfigure">n</span>, and the loop statements are</span> executed if the <span class="Subfigure">counter</span> is less than or equal to <span class="Subfigure">n</span>. Since <span class="Subfigure">n</span> holds the value 2 at the moment, while <span class="Subfigure">counter</span> holds the value 1, <span class="Subfigure">counter</span> is currently less than or equal to <span class="Subfigure">n</span>, so the body of the loop is executed.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first two loop statements display the message “The total so far is… 0”. The third line prompts the user to “Enter a number to add to the total.” and stores the user’s input into <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span>. The next line in the body of the loop adds <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span> to the <span class="Subfigure">total</span> for far. Assuming the user enters 100 for <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span>, as is the case in the example of Figure 8.19, <span class="Subfigure">total</span> would now contain 100, since 0 + 100 = 100. The last action to take place during the first pass through the loop is for 1 to be added to <span class="Subfigure">counter</span>, giving it a value of 2. Control then returns to the top of the loop.
			</p>

			<p>
				The current value of <span class="Subfigure">counter</span>, 2, is compared to the current value of <span class="Subfigure">n</span>, which is also 2. Since 2 is less than or equal to 2, the second pass through the loop begins. Lines one and two generate “The total so far is… 100”. Line three prints its prompt and stores the user’s input into <span class="Subfigure">newValue</span>, which in line four is added to total. Given 50 as the user’s input, <span class="Subfigure">total</span> would be set to 150, since 100 + 50 = 150. The variable <span class="Subfigure">counter</span> is then incremented by 1, giving it a value of 3, and control returns to the top of the loop.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since the current value of <span class="Subfigure">counter</span>, 3, is greater than <span class="Subfigure">n</span>, 2, execution of the loop terminates and control passes to the statement following the loop’s closing bracket, “}”. This statement and the next display the message “The final total is… 150”. The end of the program is then encountered and its execution ceases.
			</p>

			<p>
				The program of Figure 8.19 can be simplified somewhat by replacing its “while” loop with a “for” loop. A “for” loop is a specialized iteration construct that implements count-based loops. The “for” loop combines into a single statement, loop variable initialization, the loop condition test, and the loop variable increment operation. Each of these operations are highlighted with arrows in Figure 8.19.
			</p>

			<p>
				The general format of the “for” loop is:
			</p>

			<p class="Footnote">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <span class="T13">for (</span><span class="T39">variable</span><span class="Subfigure">=</span><span class="T39">initialValue</span><span class="Subfigure">; &nbsp; </span><span class="T39">variable</span><span class="T39">&nbsp; relationalOperator</span><span class="T39">finalValue</span><span class="Subfigure">; &nbsp; </span><span class="T39">&nbsp; variable</span><span class="Subfigure">++</span><span class="T13">)

			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp; </span> }
			</p>

			<p>
				“For” loops work in the following way. First a numeric “loop variable”, indicated above by</span> <span class="Italicized">variable</span>, is initialized to the value of</span> <span class="Italicized">initialValue</span>. The value of the loop variable is then compared to the value of</span> <span class="Italicized">finalValue</span> using the <span class="Italicized">relationalOperator</span>. If the expression <span class="Italicized">variable relationalOperator finalValue</span> is true, the <span class="Italicized">statements</span> of the loop are executed. However, if the result of the expression is false, program control immediately moves to the first statement following the loop’s closing bracket, “}”skipping over the</span> <span class="Italicized">statements</span> in this case. Assuming the expression is true, after executing the</span> <span class="Italicized">statements</span>, the loop variable will be automatically incremented by one and control will return to the top of the</span> loop where the value of the loop variable will once again be compared to the value of</span> <span class="Italicized">finalValue</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				If the result of the expression <span class="Italicized">variable relationalOperator finalValue</span> is no longer true, execution of the loop terminates and control passes to the statement following the closing bracket, “}”. Otherwise, the</span> <span class="Italicized">statements</span> of the loop are executed a second time. This process repeats itself until the loop expression eventually becomes false, at which point the loop terminates.
			</p>

			<p>
				The behavior of the “for” loop is illustrated in Figure 8.20. While certainly not always the case, the <span class="Italicized">initialValue</span> is often set at 1 and the <span class="Italicized">relationalOperator</span> is set to “&le;”. Under these circumstances, <span class="Italicized">finalValue</span> would specify the number of times the loop would be executed, while <span class="Italicized">variable</span> counts off each iteration of the loop: 1, 2, 3, …</span> <span class="Italicized">finalValue</span>. Thus, during loop execution, <span class="Italicized">variable</span> will always indicate which iteration is currently being processed.

				Figure 8.21 illustrates a “for” loop in action. The program of Figure 8.21 is simply the program of Figure 8.19 rewritten to use a “for” instead of a “while”. Notice that each of the statements marked with arrows in Figure 8.19 have been “collapsed” into the “for” construct in Figure 8.21. Namely, it is no longer necessary to initialize <span class="Subfigure">counter</span> to 1 in a separate statement prior to entering the loop, nor is it necessary to increment <span class="Subfigure">counter</span> by 1 at the bottom of the loop. These actions are now performed automatically by the “for” loop.

				Figure 8.21: &nbsp; A program to compute the sum of N numbers using a “For” loop
			</p>

			<p>
				Use of the “for” construct to implement count-based loops is preferable to implementing such loops using “while”. “For” loops are convenient from the programmer’s point of view, since they combine three statements: initialization, test, and increment, into one statement. They also increase the clarity of the program by telling the reader, up front, that the loop that is being entered is count-based.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				“For” loops eliminate a common source of errors. When implementing a count-based loop using a “while” construct, as in the program of Figure 8.19, the programmer must be careful to ensure that the last action in the body of the loop is an increment of the loop variable. If the programmer accidentally omits this increment statement, the condition controlling the loop will <span class="Ital">never</span> become false and thus the loop will never terminate. In the program of Figure 8.19, <span class="Subfigure">counter</span> would always be 1, so if the test <span class="Subfigure">counter &le; n</span> &nbsp;  &nbsp; was true when the loop was first entered, it will always be true – and the loop will never exit.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				When a program attempts to execute one of these so-called infinite loops, it gets “caught” in the loop. All that can be done at that point is to “kill” the offending program by issuing an operating system level command, such as Control-Alt-Delete in Windows.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is important to recognize that although “for” loops are quite convenient, they are not strictly necessary, since every program incorporating a “for” loop could always be rewritten using a “while” loop.

				Figure 8.22: &nbsp; A program to average grades using a “For” loop and an “If-Else” construct
			</p>

			<p>
				Is the opposite true? &nbsp; Can every program that uses a “while” be rewritten using “for”? &nbsp; The answer is “no”. “For” loops are based on counting <span class="Ital">from</span> some value <span class="Ital">to</span> some other value. A “for” loop could not be used to implement the program of Figure 8.18 since the loop in that program does not execute some fixed number of times. Instead, it repeats over and over until the user types in a value of –1. That might be the first input or it might be the hundredth or the ten thousandth. There is no way to tell.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Because “for” loops can always be replaced with “while” loops, but not all “while” loops can be replaced with “for” loops, we say that the “while” loop is “more general” than the “for”.
			</p>

			<p>
				The next program we will examine incorporates both a “for” loop and an “if-else” statement in order to compute the average of a set of grades. The program, presented in Figure 8.22, computes the average of a collection of grades entered by the user.
			</p>

			<p>
				Much of the program is similar to the one presented in Figure 8.21. It gets from the user the <span class="Subfigure">numberOfGrades</span> to be averaged, sets the <span class="Subfigure">total</span> to zero, and then enters a loop that asks for, receives, and adds to the <span class="Subfigure">total</span> each <span class="Subfigure">grade</span> entered by the user. As grades are entered, they are “echoed” to the screen using “write” and “writeln” statements. Once the final <span class="Subfigure">grade</span> has been added to the <span class="Subfigure">total</span> the loop exits and the <span class="Subfigure">average</span> can be computed and reported.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is, however, one potential snag in the above scenario. If 0 were entered by the user as the <span class="Subfigure">numberOfGrades</span>, then <span class="Subfigure">average</span> would be undefined. In fact, attempting to compute <span class="Subfigure">average</span> as <span class="Subfigure">total</span> divided by <span class="Subfigure">numberOfGrades</span> would result in a divide-by-zero error. To overcome this potential problem, the program verifies that <span class="Subfigure">numberOfGrades</span> is greater than 0 before performing the division. If it is less than or equal to zero, then the string “undefined.” is printed instead of the value of <span class="Subfigure">average</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Two separate runs of the program are illustrated in Figure 8.22. In the first run, there are three grades to be averaged: 100, 50, and 90, giving a result of 80. In the second run, the user enters 0 for the <span class="Subfigure">numberOfGrades</span>. Since the initial value of loop variable <span class="Subfigure">i</span>, 1, is greater than zero, the statements in the body of the loop are skipped. As a result, the program never requests the user to enter any grades and <span class="Subfigure">total</span> remains at zero. When the “if-else” statement is encountered the ‘average’ will be reported as “undefined.”.
			</p>

			<p>
				One final point worth making about the program of Figure 8.22 is that it will work correctly even if the user accidentally enters a negative value for <span class="Subfigure">numberOfGrades</span>. In this case, the statements in the body of the loop will be skipped and the “If” condition will be false, so the message “The average of the grades is undefined.” will be generated.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				One limitation of this program, and many other programs that use count-based loops to control user input, is that they are critically dependent on being given the correct number of input items at the beginning of the program. If the count of the number of items to be input is off, the program will either ask for too few items or for too many. Either way, users would find such behavior quite frustrating. This limitation cannot be easily overcome without abandoning the count-based approach.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thus, while the program of Figure 8.22 may be useful for averaging a handful of grades, in reality, no one would be willing to use the program to compute the average of a long list of grades. The reason for this is that in order to use the program, the user must first count how many grades are in the list. If he or she makes a mistake while counting, the user won’t discover this until either the program fails to ask grade or asks for one when no more are available.
			</p>

			<p>
				All is not lost however, since the program of Figure 8.22 could be modified to use the sentinel-based, while loop approach of Figure 8.18 for reading its input. Under this approach, the program would ask for grades until a negative number were entered, instead of requiring the user to enter the number of grades up front.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before leaving the topic of iteration, we should say a few words about the idea of “nested loops”. Two loops are “nested” when one loop appears within the body of another loop. Since there are no restrictions as to what statements can appear within the body of a loop, a “for” or “while” can certainly appear within the body of another “for” or “while”. Nesting of loops is quite common, and in fact may be carried out to an arbitrary depth. (However, to keep the logic of a program from becoming too hard to follow, programmers try to limit nesting depths to no more than three or four levels deep.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.23 presents a compact little program for printing the multiplication table. A partial listing of the program’s output is included in the figure. This program consists of two nested “for” loops. The loop variable of the outer loop is <span class="Subfigure">i</span> and the loop variable for the inner loop is <span class="Subfigure">j</span>. Both of these loops count from one to twelve.
			</p>

			<p>
				The program’s output is of the form:
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				<span class="T17">i <span class="Subfigure">times</span> <span class="T17">j <span class="Subfigure">equals</span> <span class="Italicized">x
			</p>

			<p>
				where <span class="Subfigure">i</span> &nbsp; and <span class="Subfigure">j</span> represent the values of the respective variables and</span> <span class="Italicized">x</span> is their product. Notice from the partial listing of the output in Figure 8.23 that <span class="Subfigure">j</span> runs through its entire range, from 1 to 12, before <span class="Subfigure">i</span> is incremented by 1. This behavior is easy to understand when you think about the structure of the program.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s look at the outer loop. What does it do? &nbsp; Well, first <span class="Subfigure">i</span> is initialized to 1, it is then compared to 12, and since it is not greater, the first iteration of the loop commences. The first statement of the loop prints out a blank line. The next “statement” is a loop construct. In order for the first iteration of the outer loop to complete, the program must execute this inner loop to completion.

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The inner loop begins by initializing <span class="Subfigure">j</span> to 1. Since 1 is not greater than 12, the first pass through the inner loop begins. The first statement of this loop computes the <span class="Subfigure">product</span> of <span class="Subfigure">i</span> and <span class="Subfigure">j</span>. Since they are both 1, their product is 1. Next, the following four items are printed on a single line: the current value of <span class="Subfigure">i</span>, the string “ times ”, the current value of <span class="Subfigure">j</span>, and the string “ equals ”. These are followed by the current value of <span class="Subfigure">product</span> and a new line character. Thus the string “1 times 1 equals 1” is generated. The first pass of the inner loop ends with <span class="Subfigure">j</span> being incremented from 1 to 2 and control returning to the top of that loop.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Each pass through the inner loop proceeds in a similar fashion, with <span class="Subfigure">i</span> remaining constant and <span class="Subfigure">j</span> being bumped up by one each time. So, during the second pass “1 times 2 equals 2” is printed, during the third “1 times 3 equals 3” is display, and so forth. Eventually, <span class="Subfigure">j</span> reaches 12 and &nbsp; “1 times 12 equals 12” is output. <span class="Subfigure">j</span> is then incremented to 13 and control returns to the top of the inner loop. Since 13 is greater than 12 the inner loop completes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Execution of the first pass through the outer loop can now resume. Since the inner loop was the last “statement” of the outer loop, the loop variable <span class="Subfigure">i</span> is incremented by 1, to 2, and control returns to the top of the outer loop.
			</p>

			<p>
				The current value of <span class="Subfigure">i</span>, 2, is not greater than 12, so the second pass through the outer loop begins. The first statement generates a blank line, as it did during the first pass through the loop. Next, the inner loop is encountered and its execution starts afresh. </span><span class="Subfigure">j</span> is initialized to 1. Since that value is less than 12 the statements of the loop are executed and the string “2 times 1 equals 2” is printed. Subsequent passes through the inner loop produce “2 times 2 equals 4”, “2 times 3 equals 6”, etc. Eventually, of course, the inner loop will again complete and the third pass of the outer loop can begin.
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				This process repeats itself until all 144 entries in the multiplication table, from 1</span> <span class="T59"></span> 1 to 12</span> <span class="T59"></span> 12, are computed and printed.

				We conclude this section on iteration with the program of Figure 8.24. This program prints the lyrics to the song &nbsp; “99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall”. As you most likely know, the song begins:
			</p>

			<p class="P116">

			<p>
				It continues in this manner, with one less bottle in each verse, until it finally runs out of beer. Actually, instead of beginning the song at 99 bottles, the program of Figure 8.24 asks the user to enter the number of bottles.
			</p>

			<p>
				An interesting feature of the program is that it decrements <span class="Subfigure">count</span> in the middle of the loop, rather than at the end. You should trace through the program with a few bottles to convince yourself that it does work properly. One thing you will probably notice as you do so is that when the program gets down to one beer it reports that as “1 bottles of beer on the wall.” &nbsp; While this lack of grammatical correctness might not seem like such a big deal, especially after 98 beers, I’ll ask you to correct it in the exercises.

			<p class="Section">
				8.7 &nbsp; Functions
			</p>

			<p>
				This section is concerned with creating and using function subprograms. A</span> <span class="Bolded">subprogram</span> is a program within a program. Very few “real” programs are written as one long piece of code. Instead, traditional imperative programs generally consist of large numbers of relatively simple subprograms that work together to accomplish some complex task. While it is theoretically possible to write large programs without the use of subprograms, as a practical matter any significant program must be decomposed into manageable pieces if humans are to write and maintain it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Subprograms make the construction of “software libraries” possible. A</span> <span class="Bolded">software library</span> is a collection of subprograms, or “routines” as they are sometimes called, for solving common problems that have been written, tested, and debugged. Most programming languages come with extensive libraries for performing mathematical and text string operations and for building graphical user interfaces. These languages allow programmers to “include” library routines into their code. Using subprograms from the library speeds up the software development process and results in a more reliable finished product.
			</p>

			<p>
				When a subprogram is invoked, or called, from within a program, the “calling” program pauses temporarily so that the “called” subprogram can carry out its actions. Eventually, the called subprogram will complete its task and control will once again return to the “caller”. When this occurs, the calling program “wakes up” and resumes its execution from the point it was at when the call took place.
			</p>

			<p>
				Subprograms can call other subprograms (including copies of themselves as we will see in Section 8.8). These subprograms can, in turn, call other subprograms. This “chain” of subprogram invocations can extend to an arbitrary depth as long as the “bottom” of the chain is eventually reached. It is necessary that infinite calling sequences be avoided, since each subprogram in the “chain” of subprogram invocations must eventually complete its task and return control to the program that called it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.25 illustrates the process of subprogram invocation and return. In the particular situation presented in the figure, a main program calls a subprogram named X. When this subprogram is called, execution of the main program is suspended and X begins to run. At some point during the execution of X, subprogram Y is called. When this occurs, X is temporarily suspended and control passes to Y. Likewise, during the execution of Y, subprogram Z is called. As a result, the execution of Y is suspended and Z begins to run. Subprogram Z is at the “bottom” of the calling chain, since it doesn’t call any other subprograms.  It will run to completion.
			</p>

			<p>
				When Z completes, control will return to subprogram Y. Subprogram Y will continue execution from the point at which it was suspended. At the completion of Y, control will return to subprogram X, again, at the point where it was suspended. Finally, when X completes, control will return to the main program, which can now run to completion.

				Figure 8.25: &nbsp; Subprogram invocation and return
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to the mechanisms for subprogram call and return, programs and their subprograms must have ways of passing data between one another. For example, a subprogram designed to compute</span> <span class="Italicized">x</span><span class="T53">y</span> &nbsp; (</span><span class="Italicized">x</span> raised to the</span> <span class="Italicized">y</span> power) must have a way to receive the values of</span> <span class="Italicized">x</span> and</span> <span class="Italicized">y</span> from the calling program and also must be able to return the computed result to the caller. In general, a subprogram may be passed any number of input values (zero or more) from its calling program during the subprogram invocation process. A subprogram can pass values back to its calling program during the subprogram return process.
			</p>

			<p>
				Watson JavaScript supports only one type of subprogram, known a function. The general format of a Watson JavaScript function definition is:
			</p>

			<p class="P112">
				<span class="Subfigure">function</span><span class="Italicized">name</span><span class="Subfigure">(</span><span class="Italicized">input variables <span class="Subfigure">) // returns</span> <span class="Italicized">type
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp; </span>{
			</p>

			<p class="P74">
				<span class="T15">&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span><span class="Italicized">declarations
			</p>

			<p class="P74">
				<span class="T15">&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span><span class="Italicized">statements
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp; </span>}
			</p>

			<p>
				Function definitions begin with the key word “function” followed by the name of the function that is being defined. A comma separated list of input variables and their types, text or numeric, appear after the function name, enclosed in parentheses. These variables allow the function to receive input from the calling program.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to receiving inputs from the calling program, functions may (or may not) return a result value. The type of this result: numeric, text, or “nothing”; is specified at the end of the first line of the function declaration. If the value returned by the function is a number, the “</span><span class="Subfigure">Numeric</span>” type will be specified. If the value returned by the function is a text string, the “</span><span class="Subfigure">Text</span>” type will be specified. If the function does not return a result, the keyword “</span><span class="Subfigure">nothing</span>” will be used to indicate that fact.

			<p class="Figure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Following the first line of the function declaration, the body of the function, enclosed in brackets, is presented. Since functions are subprograms, their bodies contain both variable declarations and statements.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is important to note at this point that a function declaration <span class="Italicized">defines</span> a function. These declarations define the attributes of a function: its name, its input variables and their types, the type of the function’s return result, the variables declared by the function and the statements that describe the actions to be taken by the function when executed. What a function definition does not do is actually execute, or run, the function. In order for a function subprogram to do anything it must be called.
			</p>

			<p>
				Functions are called by referring to them by name in a calling program and supplying any required input values. The general format of a Watson JavaScript function call is:
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				<span class="Italicized">functionName</span><span class="Subfigure">(</span><span class="Italicized">inputs</span><span class="Subfigure">);
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.26 presents a program that prints a simple banner of the form:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				* * * * Hello World! * * * *
			</p>

			<p>
				The program accomplishes its task by defining and then using a function subprogram named <span class="Subfigure">banner</span> that accepts a text string named <span class="Subfigure">message</span> and then prints that <span class="Subfigure">message</span> surrounded by asterisks. The <span class="Subfigure">banner</span> function does not return a value to the calling program, as its mission in life is to display a banner on the computer screen – not compute some value to be used by the calling program.
			</p>

			<p>
				Subprogram definitions in Watson JavaScript are located in the declarations section of the main program, immediately above the program statements. To help the definition of <span class="Subfigure">banner</span> stand out from the rest of the program, it is shaded in gray in Figure 8.26.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the program of Figure 8.26, <span class="Subfigure">banner</span> will receive a single input value from the calling program. This value is a text string that will be accessed through the variable <span class="Subfigure">message</span>. The statements of the <span class="Subfigure">banner</span> function will cause a simple banner to be displayed by: writing a blank line, then four asterisks, then the contents of the <span class="Subfigure">message</span> string, then four more asterisks, and finally another blank line. Note that the content of the banner’s <span class="Subfigure">message</span> is not fixed. Whatever text string is passed to this subprogram will be printed between the asterisks.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that we have discussed the definition of the <span class="Subfigure">banner</span> procedure, let’s turn our attention back to the main program. The statements that define the actions to be taken by the main program occur immediate after the function declaration. These actions consist of a single statement that calls the <span class="Subfigure">banner</span> function and passes it the string “Hello World!”.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Some people are initially put off by the fact that the main program, which is executed first, is physically located after the subprogram declarations. A moment of reflection should convince you that this really isn’t so odd, since it is reasonable to insist that subprograms be fully defined before they can be used (called).
			</p>

			<p>
				Thus, execution of the program begins with the statement:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				banner(“Hello World”);
			</p>

			<p>
				This statement is an instance of a function invocation statement where the</span> <span class="Italicized">functionName</span> is <span class="Subfigure">banner</span> and the <span class="Italicized">inputs</span> consist of the single text string “Hello World!”. In general the inputs to a function, or <span class="Italicized">arguments</span> as they are often called, consist of a comma-separated list of zero or more expressions. These expressions can be constants, variables, or general expressions involving mathematical operators. When the function invocation statement is executed, the value of each argument is computed and passed to the subprogram being called. Thus, in the present example, the string “Hello World!” is passed to the <span class="Subfigure">banner</span> subprogram, where it is mapped to the text variable <span class="Subfigure">message</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The number and type of arguments in a function invocation statement must exactly match the number and type of variables in the first line of the function declaration. If more than one value is passed to the function, the first argument is mapped to the first variable, the second argument to the second variable, and so forth.

			</p>

			<p class="P46">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.27 contains a program for raising a number to the third power. The program declares three things: an integer variable named “</span><span class="Subfigure">a</span>”, an integer variable named “</span><span class="Subfigure">b</span>”, and a function named <span class="Subfigure">power</span>. The <span class="Subfigure">power</span> function is a general purpose subprogram for raising</span> <span class="Italicized">x</span> to the</span> <span class="Italicized">y</span> power (</span><span class="Italicized">x</span><span class="T53">y</span> ) given values for both</span> <span class="Italicized">x</span> and</span> <span class="Italicized">y</span>. Unlike the <span class="Subfigure">banner</span> function, which did not need to return a value to the calling program, this subprogram must have the ability to report its results back to whomever called it.
			</p>

			<p class="P46">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The main program of Figure 8.27 begins by prompting the user to enter a value. The user’s input is then read into the numeric variable “</span><span class="Subfigure">a</span>”. The next statement:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				b = power(a,3);
			</p>

			<p>
				will raise “</span><span class="Subfigure">a</span>” to the third power and store the result in “</span><span class="Subfigure">b</span>”. It does so by embedding a call to the <span class="Subfigure">power</span> function in the right hand side expression of an assignment statement. The last three statements of the main program report this result to the user.
			</p>

			<p>
				Turing our attention to the definition of <span class="Subfigure">power</span>, we can see that the first argument passed to this subprogram will be mapped to a variable named <span class="Subfigure">x</span> and the second argument will be mapped to <span class="Subfigure">y</span>. The result returned by this program is defined to be numeric.
			</p>

			<p>
				The input variable list associated with a subprogram is often called its “parameter list”, with the individual variables called “parameters”. When called, the first argument in the argument list of the function call statement, “</span><span class="Subfigure">a</span>” in this case, is mapped to the first parameter in the function’s parameter list, “</span><span class="Subfigure">x</span>” in this case. The next argument, 3 in this case, is mapped to the next parameter in the parameter list, “</span><span class="Subfigure">y</span>” in this case. As mentioned earlier, the number of arguments, and their types, must exactly match the number and types of the variables in the function’s parameter list.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <span class="Subfigure">power</span> subprogram of Figure 8.27 declares two numeric variables for use within the body of the function. These variables, named “</span><span class="Subfigure">i</span>” and “z”, are known as a “local variables” since they exist only within the <span class="Subfigure">power</span> function. The main program doesn’t know about “</span><span class="Subfigure">i</span>” or “z”. It only knows about <span class="Subfigure">a</span>, <span class="Subfigure">b</span>, and a function named <span class="Subfigure">power</span>. Thus, the main program cannot directly access or in any way modify “</span><span class="Subfigure">i</span>” or “z”. This concept, known as “information hiding” is very important when writing sizable programs.
			</p>

			<p>
				Imagine a large program being written by a hundred programmers. Without local variables, every programmer would have to know the name of every variable used by every other programmer. This shared knowledge would be necessary in order to keep two or more people from accidentally using the same variable name for different purposes at the same time.
			</p>

			<p>
				In order to see the problem more clearly, imagine that I think <span class="Subfigure">timer</span> is my variable so I put a 0 in it. However, you think <span class="Subfigure">timer</span> is your variable and you put a 10 in it. Later, my code increments <span class="Subfigure">timer</span> by 1. At this point I think there should be a 1 in <span class="Subfigure">timer</span>, you think there should be a 10 in <span class="Subfigure">timer</span>, but we are both wrong since <span class="Subfigure">timer</span> now holds 11. </span>Any code that either of us writes that depends on the value of <span class="Subfigure">timer</span> will now be flawed and not produce the results we expect.
			</p>

			<p>
				Using subprograms and local variables avoids these kinds of situations. If a program can be divided into 100 pieces and the “interfaces” between those parts defined, then one hundred programmers could work on the program at the same time– each concentrating on his or her own subprogram. Any local variables declared in one subprogram would be completely separate from all other subprograms. Hence, you and I could both declare a variable named <span class="Subfigure">timer</span> locally in our respective subprograms. Since these would be local variables, the system would treat them as completely separate entities. Furthermore, the code I write in my subprogram will only be able to “see” my <span class="Subfigure">timer</span>, while the code you write in your subprogram will only be able to see your <span class="Subfigure">timer</span>. Any modification I make to my <span class="Subfigure">timer</span> cannot directly affect your <span class="Subfigure">timer</span>, and vice versa.
			</p>

			<p>
				Returning our attention to the definition of the <span class="Subfigure">power</span> function, we note that the algorithm it uses to compute</span> <span class="Italicized">z = x</span><span class="T53">y</span> works by first setting <span class="Subfigure">z</span> to 1 and then repeatedly multiplying the value of <span class="Subfigure">x</span> times the current value of <span class="Subfigure">z</span> over and over, a total of <span class="Subfigure">y</span> times. This makes sense because</span> <span class="Italicized">x</span><span class="T53">y</span> is simply &nbsp; </span><span class="Italicized">x</span><span class="T59"></span><span class="Italicized">x</span><span class="T59"></span><span class="Italicized">x</span> . . . <span class="T59"></span><span class="Italicized">x</span> &nbsp; where there are</span> <span class="Italicized">y</span> total</span> <span class="Italicized">x</span>’s.
			</p>

			<p>
				This algorithm is implemented in the following way. The first executable statement of <span class="Subfigure">power</span> sets <span class="Subfigure">z</span> to 1. The next line begins a “for” loop that executes a total of <span class="Ital">y</span> times as the variable <span class="Subfigure">i</span> counts from one to <span class="Subfigure">y</span>. Within the loop is a single statement that multiplies <span class="Subfigure">z</span> by <span class="Subfigure">x</span>. When the loop begins <span class="Subfigure">z</span> equals 1. After the first pass through the loop <span class="Subfigure">z</span> equals <span class="Subfigure">x</span> (or <span class="Ital">x</span><span class="T51">1</span> ), after the second pass through the loop <span class="Subfigure">z</span> equals <span class="Subfigure">x</span> times <span class="Subfigure">x</span> (or <span class="Ital">x</span><span class="T51">2</span> ), after the third pass <span class="Subfigure">x</span> times <span class="Subfigure">x</span> times <span class="Subfigure">x</span> (or <span class="Ital">x</span><span class="T51">3</span> ). Finally, after the <span class="Ital">y</span><span class="T51">th</span> pass <span class="Subfigure">z</span> will equal <span class="Ital">x</span><span class="T54">y</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The final statement in the power function is
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="P8">
				return(z);
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Return statements are used to transfer a value from a function back to the calling program – in this case, the value of <span class="Subfigure">z</span>. The general form of the <span class="Subfigure">Return</span> statement is:
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				<span class="Subfigure">return(</span><span class="Italicized">expression</span><span class="Subfigure">);
			</p>

			<p>
				The purpose of the “return” statement is to terminate execution of the current function and return the value of the</span> <span class="Italicized">expression</span> to the calling program. The</span> <span class="Italicized">expression</span> listed in the <span class="Subfigure">Return</span> statement can be a constant, variable, or general expression. The only restriction is that the type of value produced by the expression must match the</span> <span class="Italicized">type</span> specified after the keyword <span class="Subfigure">returns</span> on the first line of the function definition.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although “return” statements can occur anywhere within a function, they usually appear as the very last statement. Not all functions have “return” statements. Specifically, functions that return nothing to their calling program, such as the <span class="Subfigure">banner</span> function of Figure 8.26, generally do not include “return”
			</p>

			<p>
				When the “return” is executed, three things happen: the function ceases execution, the return value is passed back to the calling program, and the calling program “wakes up” at the point at which the function was called. Thus, when the “return” statement of Figure 8.27 is executed, control returns to the main program and the value of <span class="Subfigure">a</span><span class="T55">3</span> is assigned to “<span class="Subfigure">b</span>”.
			</p>

			<p class="P46">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.28 presents another example of a program that incorporates the <span class="Subfigure">power</span> function of Figure 8.27. The main program of Figure 8.28 computes the value of the third degree polynomial:</span> <span class="Italicized">A X</span><span class="T52">3</span><span class="Italicized">+ B X</span><span class="T52">2</span><span class="Italicized">+ C X + D</span> &nbsp; where</span> <span class="Italicized">A</span>,</span> <span class="Italicized">B</span>,</span> <span class="Italicized">C</span>,</span> <span class="Italicized">D</span>, and</span> <span class="Italicized">X</span> are numeric values entered by the user.
			</p>

			<p>
				The program begins by declaring six numeric variables: <span class="Subfigure">a</span>, <span class="Subfigure">b</span>, <span class="Subfigure">c</span>, <span class="Subfigure">d</span>, <span class="Subfigure">x</span>, and <span class="Subfigure">y</span>; and one function, <span class="Subfigure">power</span>. After declaring the variables and the function, “prompt” statements are used to read in values for <span class="Subfigure">x</span>, <span class="Subfigure">a</span>, <span class="Subfigure">b</span>, <span class="Subfigure">c</span>, and <span class="Subfigure">d</span>. The following statement is then executed:

				Figure 8.28: &nbsp; A program to compute the value of &nbsp; <span class="Subfigure">A X</span><span class="T51">3</span><span class="Subfigure">+ B X</span><span class="T51">2</span><span class="Subfigure">+ C X + D</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				This assignment statement incorporates two separate calls to the <span class="Subfigure">power</span> function. The first call to <span class="Subfigure">power</span> computes</span> <span class="Subfigure">x</span><span class="T55">3</span>, while the second call computes</span> <span class="Subfigure">x</span><span class="T55">2</span>. The manner in which <span class="Subfigure">power</span> is called illustrates an important point. Multiple function calls can be embedded within a single statement. The reason for this is that function calls are</span> <span class="Italicized">expressions</span>, rather than complete statements. As such, they can be embedded within mathematical (and text) expressions, and can thus appear wherever an expression is allowed – such as on the right hand side of assignment statements, and in “write” and “writeln” statements.
			</p>

			<p>
				When a function subprogram is called, the evaluation of the current statement in the calling program is temporarily interrupted. When the function returns, its value is substituted into the current expression at the point of the call, and execution of the interrupted statement resumes. Hence, if <span class="Subfigure">x</span> were 3, <span class="Subfigure">power(x,3)</span> would evaluate to 27 and <span class="Subfigure">power(x,2)</span> would evaluate to 9. Assuming <span class="Subfigure">a</span> was 10, <span class="Subfigure">b</span> was 20, <span class="Subfigure">c</span> was 30, and <span class="Subfigure">d</span> was 40, the above expression would be evaluated in the following way:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				y = &nbsp; a * power(x,3) + &nbsp; b * power(x,2) + &nbsp; c * x + &nbsp; d;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span> 10 * power(3,3) + 20 * power(3,2) + 30 * 3 + 40
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span> 10 * &nbsp;  &nbsp; 27 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; + 20 * power(3,2) + 30 * 3 + 40
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				So the value assigned to the variable <span class="Subfigure">y</span> under these assumptions is 580.
			</p>

			<p>
				As should be apparent from this example, function subprograms are quite convenient for implementing mathematical functions.
			</p>

			<p>
				One other point should be made about the program of Figure 8.28. The program illustrates the concept of local variable names. Note that both the main program and the <span class="Subfigure">power</span> function have variables named <span class="Subfigure">x</span> and <span class="Subfigure">y</span>.  Watson JavaScript will not confuse the variables in the main program with those of the subprogram.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the main program, <span class="Subfigure">x</span> is used to capture the user’s input and <span class="Subfigure">y</span> is used to hold the result of the computation. In the function, <span class="Subfigure">x</span> is the base of the power and <span class="Subfigure">y</span> is the exponent. It just so happens that due to the way the program is written the <span class="Subfigure">x</span> from the main program and the <span class="Subfigure">x</span> from the subprogram will always have identical values. The <span class="Subfigure">y</span> from the main</span> program and the <span class="Subfigure">y</span> from the subprogram, on the other hand, are used for completely different purposes and are unlikely to hold identical values.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s conclude this section by revisiting the <span class="Subfigure">beer</span> program of Figure 8.24. Figure 8.29 presents a revised version of this program, incorporating a function called <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span>. The main program now asks the user for the number of bottles, and stores the response in <span class="Subfigure">count</span>. </span><span class="Subfigure">singsong</span> is then called and the value of <span class="Subfigure">count</span> is passed to the input parameter, <span class="Subfigure">beers</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Subfigure">singsong</span> contains a “while” loop that prints the lyrics to each verse of the song. During each verse, one of the <span class="Subfigure">beers</span> is consumed. The loop terminates when the number of <span class="Subfigure">beers</span> is no longer greater than zero.
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The input/output behavior of this program is identical to the program of Figure 8.24 with the sole exception that “Later…” is printed at the end of the song. In fact, if it were not for this minor difference, a user would have no way of knowing which version of the program he or she was executing.

			<p class="Section">
				8.8 &nbsp; Recursion
			</p>

			<p>
				This section is concerned with the topic of recursion. </span><span class="Bolded">Recursion</span> is a type of repetition that is implemented when a subprogram calls itself. When a recursive call takes place, control is passed to what appears to be a brand new copy of the subprogram – complete with its own set of parameters and local variables. This copy of the subprogram may, in turn, call another copy of the subprogram. That copy may call another copy, and so on and so forth. Eventually, these recursive calls must terminate and return control to the original calling program.
			</p>

			<p>
				We will begin our study of recursion by turning to a familiar example, the “beer” program, first introduced in Figure 8.24 and later rewritten to use a function in Figure 8.29. Figure 8.30 presents a recursive version of <span class="Subfigure">beer</span>. At first glance you might think that this program is an identical copy of the program of Figure 8.29. There are, however, two major differences between the two. First, instead of a “for” loop in the <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span> function, this program has an &nbsp; “if” statement. Also, just before the physical end of the function definition, immediately before the “}”, the version of <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span> in Figure 8.29 calls another copy of <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span>, passing it the number of <span class="Subfigure">beers</span> that remain on the wall.

			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 8.30: &nbsp; Beer – the tail recursive version
			</p>

			<p>
				Execution of the program proceeds in the following way. First, the main program queries the user for the number of bottles. The response is stored in <span class="Subfigure">count</span>. </span><span class="Subfigure">Singsong</span> is then called and passed the value of <span class="Subfigure">count</span>. Since this is the first call to <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span>, let’s refer to this version of the procedure as <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">1</span>. Also, for the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that the user entered “2” as the number of bottles.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thus, <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">1</span> begins with two <span class="Subfigure">beers</span>. It compares its number of <span class="Subfigure">beers</span> to zero. Since two is greater than zero, the computer executes the statements in the “then” block. The first five statements of the block print the following three lines:
			</p>

			<p class="P124">
				2 bottles of beer on the wall.
			</p>

			<p class="P124">
				2 bottles of beer.
			</p>

			<p class="P124">
				Take one down. Pass it around.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Subfigure">Singsong</span><span class="T62">1</span> then subtracts one from <span class="Subfigure">beers</span> giving it a value of one. Next, the function prints:
			</p>

			<p class="P124">
				1 bottles of beer on the wall.
			</p>

			<p>
				followed by a blank line. At this point, <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">1</span> makes a recursive call to <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span>. In other words, it calls itself. Since this new call is the second call to <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span>, let’s refer to it as <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">2</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Subfigure">Singsong</span><span class="T62">2</span> receives “1” for the number of &nbsp; </span><span class="Subfigure">beers</span> from <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">1</span>. Since one is greater than zero the “then” block is executed, causing the following lines to be printed.
			</p>

			<p class="P124">
				1 bottles of beer on the wall.
			</p>

			<p class="P124">
				1 bottles of beer.
			</p>

			<p class="P124">
				Take one down. Pass it around.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Subfigure">Singsong</span><span class="T62">2</span> then subtracts one from its copy of <span class="Subfigure">beers</span> and prints:
			</p>

			<p class="P124">
				0 bottles of beer on the wall.
			</p>

			<p>
				followed by a blank line. Next, <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">2</span> encounters the recursive call and invokes a third copy of <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span>, which we will refer to as <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">3</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Subfigure">Singsong</span><span class="T62">3</span> is passed zero <span class="Subfigure">beers</span>. Since its number of <span class="Subfigure">beers</span> is not greater than zero, the statements of the “then” block are skipped and control proceeds to the statement following the end of the “if”. As there are no statements following the “if” <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">3</span> returns.
			</p>

			<p>
				But, where is this copy of <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span> supposed to return to? &nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				It returns to its caller, <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">2</span>.

				Figure 8.31: &nbsp; Illustration of the behavior of the recursive “beer” program, given 2 <span class="Subfigure">beers
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">2</span> “wakes up” at the point where the call to <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">3</span> took place. Because the call took place at the very end of the function, <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">2</span> now completes its execution. When this happens, control is returned to <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">1</span>. Likewise, <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">1</span> can now complete and return control to its caller, the main program. The main program prints “Later…” and then terminates. A graphical illustration of the behavior of this program given two <span class="Subfigure">beers</span> is presented in Figure 8.31.
			</p>

			<p>
				One way to envision recursion is to think of it as a spiral. Each time a subprogram calls itself, we descend down a level of the spiral, until we eventually reach the bottom. At that point, execution begins to “unwind” as the subprogram calls complete and we retrace our path back up through the various levels until finally arriving at the “top” level where execution began.
			</p>

			<p>
				Figures 8.30 and 8.31 illustrate what is called “tail recursion” because the recursive call is the last action taken by subprogram. In tail recursion, there is no work to be done during the “unwinding” process because it was all done on the way “down” the spiral.
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.32 contains yet another version of the “beer” program. This one illustrates “general”, as opposed to “tail”, recursion by ensuring that some work remains for the function to do after its recursive call completes.  The main feature of general recursion is that the recursive call isn’t the last executable statement performed by the subprogram.

				Figure 8.32: &nbsp; Beer – the general recursive version
			</p>

			<p>
				The output generated by the program when started with two beers is included in Figure 8.32. To help you trace through the recursive calls, the name and level number of the subprogram that generated each line of output is shown, with “main” being used to indicate output generated by the main program.
			</p>

			<p>
				As you can see, on the way down through the levels of recursion, the output produced by this program is identical to that of Figure 8.30. It is only when the program reaches the lowest level, with zero <span class="Subfigure">beers</span>, that we notice any difference. Due to the existence of the “else” block, when <span class="Subfigure">beers</span> is equal to zero, the current version of <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span> prints “We’re out of beer.” &nbsp; before it terminates. In the example run included in Figure 8.32, there were only two <span class="Subfigure">beers</span> to begin with, so we run out at <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">3</span>. At the completion of this version of the subprogram, control returns to the statement in <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">2</span> immediately following the recursive call.  That statement is <span class="Subfigure">document.writeln(“Hic.”);</span> which is executed. Since this statement is the last statement of the “then” block, and the physical end of the function immediately follows the end of this “if-else” block, <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">2</span> terminates. Control then returns to the <span class="Subfigure">document.writeln(“Hic.”);</span> statement in <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">1</span>. After executing this statement, <span class="Subfigure">singsong</span><span class="T62">1</span> terminates, and control returns to the main program. That program prints “Later…” and execution concludes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Many students, upon learning how recursion works, worry that programs that employ this form of repetition might be very inefficient in terms of their utilization of machine resources – after all you have all of those “copies” of the subprogram hanging around. Well the good news is that recursion is not nearly as expensive as you probably think. For one thing, only one copy of the actual subprogram code is needed. All that is reproduced during each call is the “execution environment”, the variables and whatnot that are used by that “version” of the subprogram. While it is true that recursion generally involves more overhead than iteration, recursive calls are really no more expensive than any other kind of function call. In fact, some optimizing compilers convert tail recursion into iteration so there is often no additional expense in using that form of recursion at all.
			</p>

			<p>
				Aside from the efficiency issue, you may be wondering why programming languages would support recursion. After all, whenever the need for repetition arises the programmer could always use one of the iteration constructs: “for” or “while”.
			</p>

			<p>
				The reasons for supporting both recursion and iteration are the same as those for supporting two types of selection statements ( “if” and “if-else”) as well as two types of iteration constructs (“for” and “while”): clarity and convenience. Some problems are simply easier to solve using recursion than iteration. For these types of problems, a recursive solution is often more compact and easier to read than an iterative one.
			</p>

			<div>
				An example of a common mathematical function that lends itself to a recursive solution is “factorial”. The factorial function frequently shows up in engineering, science, and statistics formulas. Factorial takes as input a non-negative integer (zero or greater) and produces a positive integer (one or greater). Mathematicians use the symbol “!” for factorial.</span> <span class="Footnote_20_Symbol"><span class="Footnote_20_anchor" title="Footnote: I’ll never forget the first time I ran across the “!” notation and thought to myself: “Boy, the guy who wrote this math text is really getting excited…”"><a href="#ftn7" id="body_ftn7">7</a></span></span></span> &nbsp; The symbol appears immediately following the integer constant or variable representing input to the function (e.g., &nbsp; 3! or N!).</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				Factorial is defined recursively as:
			</p><!--Next 'div' was a 'text:p'.-->

				Using the above definition, we see that 0! is explicitly defined to equal one. The factorial of all other non-negative integers,</span> <span class="Italicized">N</span>, is defined as</span> <span class="Italicized">N</span> times the factorial of the integer one less than</span> <span class="Italicized">N</span>. Thus,
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				1! &nbsp; = &nbsp; 1</span> <span class="T59"></span> 0!
			</p>

			<p>
				and, since 0! = 1,
			</p>

			<p class="P83">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; 1! &nbsp; = &nbsp; 1</span> <span class="T59"></span> 0! &nbsp; = &nbsp; 1</span> <span class="T59"></span> 1 &nbsp; = &nbsp; 1
			</p>

			<p>
				Likewise, the value of 2! is:
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				2! &nbsp; = &nbsp; 2</span> <span class="T59"></span> 1! &nbsp; = &nbsp; 2</span> <span class="T59"></span> 1 &nbsp; = &nbsp; 2
			</p>

			<p>
				3! is
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				3! &nbsp; = &nbsp; 3</span> <span class="T59"></span> 2! &nbsp; = &nbsp; 3</span> <span class="T59"></span> 2 &nbsp; = &nbsp; 6
			</p>

			<p>
				and 4! is
			</p>

			<p class="P60">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; 4! &nbsp; = &nbsp; 4</span> <span class="T59"></span> 3! &nbsp; = &nbsp; 4</span> <span class="T59"></span> 6 &nbsp; = &nbsp; 24
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure 8.33 illustrates a Watson JavaScript function for computing factorial. The contents of the subprogram read “If</span> <span class="Italicized">N</span> is equal to zero then the result is one, otherwise the result is</span> <span class="Italicized">N</span><span class="T59"></span> (</span><span class="Italicized">N</span>-1)!. Return the result.” &nbsp; The JavaScript function clearly reflects the mathematical definition. The factorial function could be rewritten using iteration, rather</span> than recursion, but such a subprogram would not follow the mathematical definition of factorial as closely as the recursive version. Thus, the recursive version is preferred.

				8.9 &nbsp; Arrays and high-level data structures
			</p>

			<p>
				We now come to the final section of this chapter on imperative programming using Watson JavaScript. This section introduces the array data structure and illustrates how it can be used to implement higher-level data structures, such as stacks, which were described in Chapter 7.
			</p>

			<p>
				Data in Watson JavaScript can be represented using two “structures”: variables and arrays. By now, you should be well acquainted with variables. But arrays are something new. An</span> <span class="Bolded">array</span> is a collection of data values, all of the same type, which are stored in contiguous memory locations and accessed via an array name and subscript. A</span> <span class="Bolded">subscript</span> is an integer constant or variable that is used to indicate the relative position of an individual item in the array.
			</p>

			<p>
				A ten-element integer array is illustrated in Figure 8.35. This array happens to be located in the computer’s memory at addresses 1000 to 1009, but it could just as easily have been located elsewhere. Immediately to the left of each element is the array name and subscript used to reference that element. The name of this particular array is <span class="Subfigure">A</span>. The first position of <span class="Subfigure">A</span> contains the value 10, the second position the value 999, the third 50, and so forth. Note that the elements are stored in “contiguous” memory locations – the first element is “next to” the second element, which is next to the third, which is next to the fourth, etc.

				Figure 8.35: &nbsp; An illustration of a ten-element integer array
			</p>

			<p>
				In Watson JavaScript, arrays are declared just below variables and before functions at the top of the program. Array declarations in Watson JavaScript use the following syntax:
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Subfigure">var</span><span class="Italicized">name <span class="Subfigure">= new Array(</span><span class="Italicized">size</span><span class="Subfigure">); //</span><span class="Italicized">type
			</p>

			<p>
				where</span> <span class="Italicized">name</span> is the name of the array,</span> <span class="Italicized">size</span> is the number of individual elements that can be stored in the array, and</span> <span class="Italicized">type</span> is the type of those elements, either numeric or text. Hence, the ten-element integer array named <span class="Subfigure">A</span> illustrated in Figure 8.35 would be declared in Watson JavaScript as:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				var A = new Array(10); // Numeric
			</p>

			<p>
				Once declared, the individual elements of an array can be accessed for retrieval or modification. An “array reference” consists of the array name followed immediately by a subscript enclosed in square brackets. Subscripts indicate the “position” or element of an array. An important thing to note about array subscripts (in languages such as C, C++, Java, and JavaScript) is that the first element of an array is said to be at index position zero.  Thus, <span class="Subfigure">A[0]</span> is a reference to the first element of <span class="Subfigure">A</span>, while <span class="Subfigure">A[1]</span> is a reference to the second element of <span class="Subfigure">A</span>, and <span class="Subfigure">A[2]</span> is a reference to the third element of <span class="Subfigure">A</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				An array reference can appear in a program pretty much anywhere a variable is allowed: in assignment statements, in “prompt” statements, in “write” and “writeln”, as function arguments, and in the relational expressions of “if”, “if-else”, “while”, and “for” statements.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the statements:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[0] = 10;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[4] = 2001;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[7] = 37;
			</p>

			<p>
				would initialize the first, fifth, and eighth elements of <span class="Subfigure">A</span> to the values shown in Figure 8.35. The other elements could be initialized in a similar manner. The value of the eighth element of <span class="Subfigure">A</span>, which is located at <span class="Subfigure">A[7]</span>, could be copied to a variable named <span class="Subfigure">X</span> with a statement such as:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				X = A[7];
			</p>

			<p>
				Given the values in Figure 8.35, this statement would place 37 into <span class="Subfigure">X</span>. The value of <span class="Subfigure">A[7]</span>could be incremented by 5, from 37 to 42, with the following statement:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[7] = A[7] + 5;
			</p>

			<p>
				It is also possible to directly print the value of an array element. The following statement displays value of the fifth element of <span class="Subfigure">A</span>, 2001.
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				document.writeln(A[4]);
			</p>

			<p>
				A subscript can be a numeric variable as well as a constant. This means that the pair of statements:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				J = 6;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[J] = 42;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				can be used to place the value 42 into <span class="Subfigure">A[6]</span>, the seventh element of <span class="Subfigure">A</span>. This is so because the semantics of the assignment statement dictate that the value of the expression on the right hand side of the assignment operator is copied into the location specified by the variable or array element on the left hand side. Similarly, the following statements will retrieve a copy of the value stored at <span class="Subfigure">A[1]</span>, the value 999 according to Figure 8.35, and place it into <span class="Subfigure">X</span>.
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				I = 1;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				X = A[I];
			</p>

			<p>
				Most students have little trouble with the idea of array access as long as constants are used for the subscripts. Many become confused, however, when variables are used. It is easy for you to avoid confusion by</span> <span class="Italicized">immediately</span> looking up the</span> <span class="Italicized">current</span> value of any subscript variables</span> <span class="Italicized">before</span> you try to figure out the behavior of a statement that contains array references.
			</p>

			<p>
				Applying this approach to the following statements:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				J = 5;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				I = J + 3;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[I] = A[J] – 2;
			</p>

			<p>
				We see that the first statement places a 5 in <span class="Subfigure">J</span>. The second statement adds the current value of <span class="Subfigure">J</span> to 3 and stores the result in <span class="Subfigure">I</span>. Since <span class="Subfigure">J</span> is 5, the result of the addition is 8, which is placed into <span class="Subfigure">I</span>. Thus, when the third statement is reached, <span class="Subfigure">I = 8</span> and <span class="Subfigure">J = 5</span>, so the statement would be, at that moment in time, equivalent to
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[8] = A[5] – 2;
			</p>

			<p>
				Since the value of <span class="Subfigure">A[5]</span> is 1066 (according to Figure 8.35), element &nbsp; </span><span class="Subfigure">A[8]</span> is assigned the result of 1066 - 2, or 1064. This value overwrites any value previously stored in <span class="Subfigure">A[8]</span>, such as 99 according to Figure 8.35.

			<p>
				The true power of variable subscripts becomes apparent when it is necessary to perform a specific operation on many individual array elements. For example, let’s say that we wanted to initialize all ten elements of the array of Figure 8.35 to zero.
			</p>

			<p>
				One approach would be to use ten separate assignment statements, one for each element of the array, like so:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[0] = 0;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[1] = 0;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[2] = 0;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[3] = 0;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[4] = 0;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[5] = 0;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[6] = 0;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[7] = 0;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[8] = 0;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[9] = 0;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				While this approach works, a much more flexible and compact solution to the array initialization problem can be obtained by using an iteration construct, such as “for”, to repeat a single assignment statement multiple times. In order for this technique to work, the assignment statement must reference the array elements using a variable subscript.
			</p>

			<p>
				The technique is illustrated in Figure 8.36. The program presented in that figure declares a ten-element array <span class="Subfigure">A</span>, and an integer variable <span class="Subfigure">i</span>. The variable is used to control a “for” loop that executes a total of ten times. Contained within the loop is a statement that assigns zero to the element at index position <span class="T39">i</span> of <span class="Subfigure">A</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The first time through the loop <span class="Subfigure">i</span> will be 0, so the statement in the body of the loop is equivalent to:
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[0] = 0;
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The next time through, <span class="Subfigure">i</span> will be 1, so the statement is equivalent to:
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[1] = &nbsp; 0;
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				This pattern continues with <span class="Subfigure">i</span> being incremented by one each time through the loop until finally <span class="Subfigure">i</span> equals 9.
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span>var A = new Array(10); // Numeric
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span>var i; &nbsp; // Numeric
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span>for (i = 0; i &le; 9; i++)
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span>{
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;  A[i] = 0;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span>}
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; </span>. . .
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 8.36: &nbsp; A partial program that declares a ten-element array and initializes each of its elements to zero
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				At this point the statement in the loop body is equivalent to:
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				A[9] = 0;
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The loop variable is then incremented to 10, but since that is greater than 9, execution of the loop terminates.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				This example illustrates an important problem solving technique. In general, when one wants to perform an operation of some sort on each of the elements of an <span class="Ital">N</span> element array, the desired operation is written in terms of some generic element (such as the element at index position <span class="Ital">i</span>). The operation is then embedded within a repetition construct that is programmed to execute <span class="Ital">N</span> times.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Using iteration constructs and variable-based array references leads to compact and flexible programs. Even with the small ten-element array of Figure 8.35, initializing all of the array elements to zero with the program of Figure 8.36 required only four lines of code (after discounting variable declarations), rather than the ten lines of code that would be needed if we avoided iteration.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The advantage of the iterative approach becomes even more pronounced when we consider larger arrays. For example, let’s assume that we wanted to increase the size of array <span class="Subfigure">A</span> from 10 to 100 elements, and initialize each of these one hundred elements to zero. Regardless of the fact that we are increasing the amount of work to be done tenfold, the required changes to the program of Figure 8.36 are actually relatively minor.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				First, in order to construct the larger array, the array declaration statement would have to be modified to read:
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span>var A = new Array(100); // Numeric
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The only other change required to the program of Figure 8.36 would be to update the “for” loop to allow it to repeat 100 times.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				&nbsp;  &nbsp; </span>for (i = 0; i &le; 99; i++)
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				If we had chosen to avoid iteration and use individual assignment statements with constant-based array references, initializing the 100-element array would have required one hundred separate assignment statements. Clearly, the use of iteration and variable-based array references are critical for solving problems involving sizable arrays.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				By combining both arrays and loops, programmers can solve all sorts of problems that involve processing large amounts of data.  For example, Figure 8.37 presents a function subprogram that performs a sequential search of a 100-element array for a target item. As you may recall from Chapter 5, search algorithms generally accept as input a list and a target item. Their task is to determine whether the target item is present in the list.
			</p>

			</p>

			<p class="Subfigure">
				}
			</p>

			<p class="P11">

			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 8.37: &nbsp; A function subprogram for searching a numeric array
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The sequential search algorithm accomplishes this task by comparing the target item to each of the items of the list, starting with the first item and continuing to search until either a list item identical to the target item is found or all of the list items have been examined. The sequential search procedure was outlined in Figure 5.4 of Chapter 5.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				In the function of Figure 8.37, a numeric array of indeterminate size, named <span class="Subfigure">list</span>, will hold the items to be searched. Another numeric variable, <span class="Subfigure">size</span>, will specify the number of elements stored in the list. A third numeric variable named <span class="Subfigure">target</span> will contain the value we are looking for. Since all three of these variables specify inputs to the function, they are declared in the function parameter list.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Instead of printing messages to report whether or not the target item occurs in the list (as was done in Figure 5.4), this function returns an integer number that indicates the index position of the first list item that matches the target. If no list item matches the target, a value of –1 is returned to indicate an unsuccessful search.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The implementation of the function is rather straightforward. It consists of a “for” loop that executes <span class="Subfigure">size</span> number of times, with <span class="Subfigure">i</span> going from 0 to <span class="Subfigure">size - 1</span>. Thus, if the size of the array is 15, the loop will execute 15 times, with <span class="Subfigure">i</span> having the value of 0 during the first pass through the loop and 14 during the final pass. If the size of the array is 1,000, the loop will execute 1,000 times. Within the loop is a single “if” statement that tests to see whether the target item is equal to the item at index position <span class="Subfigure">i</span> of the array.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				If they are not equal, no action is taken. If they are equal, the subscript of the current item is returned and the function terminates execution. Assuming the loop completes, in other words it executes all <span class="Subfigure">size</span> times with <span class="Subfigure">i</span> going from 0 to <span class="Subfigure">size – 1</span>, then the target is not in the list and the <span class="Subfigure">Return(-1);</span> statement is executed.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				You should note that this program illustrates two new features of Watson JavaScript. First, it shows that arrays, as well as variables, can be listed as input parameters to functions. The second feature debuting in the program is the use of multiple return statements. The function can “exit” at two different points: one corresponding to the case where the target item is found, the other to the case where the target is not found.

				Stacks were discussed in detail in Chapter 7. Essentially a stack is a first-in, first-out data structure. Items can be placed onto the top of the stack via the “push” operator and removed from the top by “pop”.

				Figure 8.38: &nbsp; An implementation of the stack data structure in Watson JavaScript
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The program of Figure 8.38 constructs a stack out of an array, a variable, and two functions. The array will hold the actual stack items, the variable keeps up with the position of the “top” item of the stack, and the two functions implement the actual “push” and “pop” operations. The stack is designed to hold at most 100 numbers. Only numbers, as opposed to text, may be stored in this stack.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The main program begins by declaring the numeric variable <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> and the 100-item numeric array <span class="Subfigure">STACK</span>. <span class="Subfigure">STACK</span>’s declaration reserves room for 100 elements. Thus, numbers may be stored in positions <span class="Subfigure">STACK[0]</span> through <span class="Subfigure">STACK[99]</span>. Next, the functions <span class="Subfigure">push</span> and <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> are declared.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The first action of the main program is to initialize the stack to its “empty” configuration by setting <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> to –1. Why do we do this? &nbsp; Well, remember that <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> is always supposed to point to the top item in the stack. When the stack is empty, when there are no items in the stack, there is no top item. Setting <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> to –1, which is one less than the first position of the stack array, <span class="Subfigure">STACK[0]</span>, makes sense as a way to indicate there is no top item at the moment.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Following initialization of the stack to its empty configuration, the main program pushes three items onto the stack: 10, 20, and 30. It then proceeds to pop each item off the stack and print returned values. The actions of the “push” operations are illustrated in Figure 8.39. The actions of the “pop” operations are shown in Figure 8.40.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s now take a closer look at the details of how the <span class="Subfigure">push</span> and <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> functions are implemented.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The purpose of the <span class="Subfigure">push</span> function is to add an item to the top of the stack, if there is room to do so. It receives as input from its calling program an <span class="Subfigure">item</span> that is to be stored on the top of the stack. The push function does not have a return value, since its purpose is to modify the stack not to return a value to its calling program.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				<span class="Subfigure">Push</span> begins by comparing the current value of TOP to 99 in order to determine whether there is room in the <span class="Subfigure">STACK</span> array to accept another item. Remember, the simple stack implementation illustrated in Figure 8.38 can hold at most 100 items – in positions <span class="Subfigure">STACK[0]</span> through <span class="Subfigure">STACK[99]</span>. If <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> is currently less than 99, there is room in the array for at least one more item, so <span class="Subfigure">push</span> increments the <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> variable by one and then places the <span class="Subfigure">item</span> into array position <span class="Subfigure">STACK[TOP]</span>. Note that if <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> is equal to 99 the <span class="Subfigure">STACK</span> array is full and <span class="Subfigure">push</span> takes no action.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				The purpose of the <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> function is to remove the top item from the stack and return it to the calling program. <span class="Subfigure">Pop</span> has no input parameters, since the calling program doesn’t need to pass any values to <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> for it to carry out its task. The function begins by declaring <span class="Subfigure">item</span> to be a local numeric variable. Note that the <span class="Subfigure">item</span> declared in <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> is completely separate from the <span class="Subfigure">item</span> parameter used in <span class="Subfigure">push</span>.  Next, <span class="Subfigure">Pop</span> compares <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> to zero.

				Part(c) – The state of the stack after the third pop operation
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p class="Figure">
				Figure 8.40: &nbsp; The behavior of the <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> operations
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				If <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> is greater than or equal to zero, then the stack is not empty. If this is the case, <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> will take three actions. First, <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> will assign to <span class="Subfigure">item</span> the value of the element currently at the top of the stack, <span class="Subfigure">STACK[TOP]</span>.  Second, the <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> variable is decremented by one in order to denote the “removal” of this element from the stack. Finally, the value of the <span class="Subfigure">item</span> is returned to the calling program – allowing <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> to report back to the caller the item that was popped off the stack. It is important to note that even through the <span class="Subfigure">stack</span> array itself is not modified by <span class="Subfigure">pop</span>, the stack is one item “shorter” due to the change in the value of <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				If <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> is less than zero, the stack is empty and there is no value to return. However, since <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> must return a number (according to “Returns Numeric” in the first line of the declaration) it simply returns zero in this case.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				A feature of Watson JavaScript exploited by this program is that functions have the ability to access variables that are declared in the main program. Although TOP and STACK are defined in the main program, they are used by both the <span class="Subfigure">push</span> and <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> functions. It is important to remember that even though functions can “see” variables declared in the main program, the main program cannot “see” the variables declared by functions. Thus, statements in <span class="Subfigure">pop</span> can access the main program variable <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span>, but statements in the main program cannot access the variable <span class="Subfigure">item</span> which was declared in <span class="Subfigure">pop</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				While this implementation of a stack provides an excellent “capstone” example of the capabilities of Watson JavaScript programs, it also exposes a number of the language’s limitations.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				One limitation imposed by using an array as the underlying data structure is that the maximum number of items that will be stored in the stack must be known when the program is written. This is necessary in order to specify the size of the array.  &nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				There are other, more subtle, “problems” with this implementation of a stack. Most of these problems are rooted in the fact that Watson JavaScript does not fully support object-oriented concepts.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Probably the most serious of these problems is that the definition of the stack is spread across the program – it exists as an array, a separate variable to keep up with the top item, and two separate functions for pushing and popping items on and off the stack.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				In a true object-oriented language, all of the components that define the behavior of the stack could be “encapsulated” into an object. Doing so would have great benefits – such a preventing some part of the code from accidentally (or maliciously) changing the <span class="Subfigure">TOP</span> pointer thereby breaking the functionality of the stack.
			</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				There are many other benefits to implementing programs in languages that support object-oriented features. Many of these benefits will be discussed in Chapter 10.

These programs, which generally computed tables of values based on various formulas, were used for engineering design, financial analysis, and economic modeling. Today, most of these tasks can be accomplished with general-purpose spreadsheets.
