  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">From the earliest days of computing, humans have been fascinated by the prospect of constructing intelligent machines. This chapter introduces the field of artificial intelligence.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Artificial intelligence</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(AI) is a branch of computer science that has as its goal the construction of a general-purpose intelligence – of constructing machines that are capable of doing all of the things which, at the present time, people are better. Some of the topics associated with the field of AI include creating machines that can: see and recognize objects in the real world, including people; converse fluently in human languages, such as English, and translate between different human languages; safely drive a car; plan and reason as people do; play strategy games like chess or Go, and knowledge games like</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Jeopardy!</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">; display creativity and discover new knowledge. Essentially, AI seeks to make computers more like people.</font></font></p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Section 14.2 provides an overview of artificial intelligence including the goals of the field, its underlying assumptions, a brief history of the field, and a summary of progress to date in a number of areas. Section 14.3 describes a variety of topics that have been studied in the effort to achieve intelligent behavior in machines, including: game playing and search, automated reasoning, and neural networks and machine learning. The presentation of these topics is independent from one another, so the instructor and/or student can pick and choose which areas are of interest.</font></font></p>

  </div>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The goal of artificial intelligence is to construct a general-purpose intelligence – a machine that can interact with a human, more or less, as an equal. What capabilities would a machine have to possess before it could be considered intelligent? Is it possible to construct such a machine? Could we even tell if such machines were truly intelligent?</font></font></p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">We begin by describing the capabilities of a fictional intelligent computer, the HAL 9000, in order to examine the features commonly associated with the notion of intelligent machines. We then turn our attention to the question of whether constructing such an intelligent machine is even feasible. Next, the question of how we should go about measuring progress towards achieving artificial intelligence is discussed. The final portions of this section of the chapter focus on an overview of the history of artificial intelligence and some of its accomplishments to date.</font></font></p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Many people consider HAL, the fictional computer in Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke’s 1968 movie “2001: A Space Odyssey,” to be the best depiction of an intelligent machine ever produced. The movie was groundbreaking at the time and much of what it has to say about machine intelligence is still relevant nearly half a century later.</font></font></p>

  <div>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">HAL: Good evening, Dave.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">DAVE: How ya’ doin’ Hal?</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">HAL: Everything’s running smoothly. And you?</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">DAVE: Oh, not too bad.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">HAL: Have you been doing some more work?</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">DAVE: A few sketches.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">HAL: May I see them?</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">DAVE: Sure.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">HAL: That’s a very nice rendering, Dave. I think you’ve improved a great deal.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Can you hold it a bit closer?</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">DAVE: Sure.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">HAL: That’s Doctor Hunter isn’t it?</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">DAVE: uh hum.</span></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">HAL: By the way, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">DAVE: No, not at all.</font></font></p>

  <div>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Those of you who have seen the movie will know that HAL is the computer that serves as the “brain and central nervous system” of the Discovery spaceship. HAL is capable of many feats that surpass even the most advanced computers today. For example, the astronauts aboard Discovery interact with HAL by simply talking to “him” – he is fully capable of understanding and speaking English.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>

  <div>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Computer scientists call this ability to understand human languages, both written and spoken,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>natural language understanding</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">. The ability to use language effectively is considered by computer scientists to be one of the most important characteristics of an intelligent entity. Constructing a machine with this ability has proven to be a tremendously difficult challenge.</font></font></p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Let’s consider for a moment what it takes to understand spoken language. The first problem is just trying to identify the individual words in an utterance. When we humans speak, we tend to run all of our words together into one continuous stream. We don’t usually think about this since we “hear” the individual words – that is until we try to learn a foreign language.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Compounding the word identification problem is the fact that no two people will pronounce the same word exactly the same way. Even if we limit ourselves to constructing a system to recognize the voice of a single speaker, the sound that represents a word will still change depending on all sorts of factors, such as: what other words surround it, the emphasis the speaker wishes to place on it, and even whether the speaker is ill or has been drinking. There is also the problem of separating out background noise – deciding what portions of an incoming audio stream represent voice and which represent other sounds.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Once the individual words have been recognized, the thorny issue of what they actually mean must be addressed. This problem is constrained somewhat by the structure, or</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>syntax</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, of the language being spoken (e.g.,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>verb verb</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is not a valid sentence form in English). Nonetheless, the problem remains extraordinarily challenging, primarily because a great deal of</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>common sense knowledge</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is frequently required to understand the meaning of even the simplest of utterances. Think about the knowledge HAL needs of informal English usage and human relations, specifically greetings and appropriate ways to respond, in order to make sense of Dave’s “How ya’ doin’ Hal?”</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In addition to being able to communicate fluently in English, HAL could also see what the crew was up to through cameras that were located throughout the ship. HAL could recognize individual crewmembers by their appearance. For example, in the dialog of Figure 14.1, when Dave walks by one of HAL’s consoles, HAL recognizes him and says “Good evening, Dave.” Also, when Dave shows HAL his sketchpad, HAL is able to recognize the line drawings as artwork and interpret the images as representations of the people Dave had drawn.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Computer vision</b></font></font> <font size="3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">is the subdiscipline of artificial intelligence that seeks to construct machines that can see. This field consists of much more than simply connecting digital cameras to computers; it concerns trying to develop ways of automating the process of image understanding. To illustrate, most smart phones include built-in cameras which we use to take photos, record movies, and engage in Skype or FaceTime video chats. While these cameras are very useful, they don’t, in general, give our smart phones the ability to “see” in the sense that HAL could or that people can. While our phones are capable of recording and displaying visual information, and can transmit and receive images and video over the Internet, they have no understanding of the meaning of those images.</font><a href="../Text/FootNotes.html#sdfootnote3" id="footNote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Throughout the movie, HAL displays other behaviors that are associated with intelligence. He is able to play games such as chess. He can recognize problems (such as potential threats to his mission), plan ways to solve those problems, implement those plans, and then learn from his mistakes.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Problem solving</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>planning</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>learning</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">are all areas of research in artificial intelligence. The idea of constructing computers with these attributes causes some people concern; due to the fact that computers are often used in life critical situations (such as monitoring patients in intensive care units) and that these three features (problem solving, planning, and learning) require computers to have some degree of independence from humans.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">What if a computer were to misunderstand an instruction and seriously injure or kill someone as a result. For example, perhaps an artificially intelligent computer in a health care facility has among its goals: searching for ways to decrease patient suffering, to decrease the number of days a patient spends in ICU, and to limit their medical costs as much as possible consistent with its other goals. It would be important to make sure the system firmly understood that cutting off a terminal patient’s oxygen supply was not an acceptable course of action, even though doing so would accomplish all three of the stated goals.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There are a number of other characteristics that HAL displays which are harder to quantify yet of vital importance to humans. HAL appears to be self-aware and has a “life philosophy” which he sums up in a BBC interview as: “I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.” HAL also exhibits emotions, such as pride and fear.</font></font></p>

    <h5 id="sigil_toc_id_3" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">14.2.2 Can intelligent machines be constructed?</font></font></h5>

    <div>
      <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><br /></font></font>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Is it possible for a machine to be intelligent? If one discounts the mystical, then the answer to this question is certainly yes, since humans are themselves biological “machines” – machines that are self-aware.</font></font><a href="../Text/FootNotes.html#sdfootnote4sym" id="foootNote2"><sup>2</sup></a>&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Knowing that intelligent machines exist does not answer the question of whether humans can construct them. While most computer scientists think that constructing machines capable of intelligent behavior is possible, it is conceivable that we humans may simply be too dumb to ever figure out how to build an intelligent machine.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">So, how should we go about trying to construct an artificial intelligence? There are two general approaches taken by AI researchers in their attempts to automate intelligent behavior. One approach is often called</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>machine learning</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">while the other approach goes by the name</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>symbolic AI</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Symbolic AI</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">focuses on developing systems composed of explicit rules that manipulate data in ways designed to produce seemingly intelligent behavior. The underlying rules are designed by people and encoded into computer programs. Symbolic AI is the “classic” approach to artificial intelligence. Much of the early success in the field, with topics such as game playing, automated reasoning, and expert systems, resulted from this approach. Symbolic AI has been less successful when attempting to automate lower-level behaviors such as understanding natural (human) languages and computer vision.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">As opposed to traditional symbolic AI systems in which humans try to figure out the rules underlying a process and then encode those rules as computer programs,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>machine learning</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">systems are based on the idea of designing a system that learns by example. While a symbolic approach to character recognition might attempt to generate an explicit list of the features that make a capital “A” an “A” – such as the angle of the two lines that form the outer shape of the letter, the position of the cross bar, etc. – a machine learning approach would instead focus on constructing a system that could be shown many different examples of the letter “A” and then discover for itself the features that make an “A” an “A” as opposed to a “B”.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Some approaches to machine learning are biologically inspired, such as artificial neural networks which model certain aspects of the structure and function of biological neural systems (brains). Other approaches are based on more abstract mathematical models, such as Bayesian networks. In recent years, the machine learning approach, when paired with the vast quantities of data now available over the Internet and today’s faster processors, has yielded significant progress in areas such as speech recognition, natural (human) language translation, and vision.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Whether or not these approaches (symbolic AI and machine learning) have a shot at achieving intelligent behavior depends on an underlying assumption or hypothesis – known as the</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>physical symbol system hypothesis</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">– being true. The</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>physical symbol system hypothesis</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">states that physical symbol systems are capable of generating intelligent behavior. In other words, intelligent behavior can be encoded into such a system. A</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>physical symbol system</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is a collection of physical patterns (such as written characters or magnetic charges), called</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>symbols,</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">together with a set of processes (or rules) for manipulating those symbols (e.g., creating, modifying, deleting, and reordering them). A computer is a real world device that can be used to implement physical symbol systems, since computers are capable of both storing symbols (generally represented as strings of 0’s and 1’s) and manipulating those symbols under program control.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">While most AI researchers believe the physical symbol system hypothesis to be true, it is only a hypothesis, not a proven fact. Some philosophers, on the other hand, are not convinced and believe that intelligent</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>behavior</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">will never be achieved by computers or any other physical symbol system. Others believe that although the development of machines that act in an intelligent manner is possible, or even likely, such systems will never be</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>truly</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">intelligent. In other words, these philosophers think that while it is possible that a machine may at some point be able to “mimic” intelligent behavior so as to fool people into thinking it is intelligent, it will never really “be” intelligent – just a good fake.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">These two schools of thought go by the names</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>weak AI</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>strong AI</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Weak AI</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">refers to machines that</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>behave</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">in an intelligent manner, but makes no claim as to whether or not the underlying system is truly intelligent.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Strong AI</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">refers to machines that not only act in an intelligent manner, but also</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>are</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">intelligent.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">At first glance, the debate over weak verses strong AI may appear pointless. After all, the debate is not over how the systems behave, but over the subtler question of whether machines can really possess self-awareness.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The answer that we humans settle on to this rather esoteric question will eventually have an enormous impact on how we treat machines that display intelligent behavior.</font></font><a href="../Text/FootNotes.html#footNote3" id="footNote3o">3</a>&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If we view them as elaborate devices then they will have no rights – one cannot be cruel to a microwave oven after all. If on the other hand we choose to view them as true intelligences then humans will be faced with a large number of rather thorny moral issues: Is it possible to be cruel to an AI? Should ownership of an AI be allowed, or would it be equivalent to slavery? What if we could construct AI’s so that they enjoyed doing what we wanted, wouldn’t that solve the moral problems associated with owning them? Well, the vast majority of humans have decided that slavery is morally repugnant irrespective of whether or not the slave might claim to be happy with his or her station in life. Shouldn’t the same moral arguments apply to all truly intelligent beings?</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If computer scientists ever succeed in the goal of creating machines that seem to act in an intelligent manner, this debate over AI rights is likely to become extremely heated – as the economic and social consequences could be enormous – perhaps even more heated than the current debate over abortion that rages in the US. In general, one’s opinion on abortion is primarily determined by whether one believes “personhood” begins at conception, birth, or somewhere in between.</font></font><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="../Text/FootNotes.html#sdfootnote6sym" id="sdfootnote6anc"><sup>4</sup></a> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This question has no definitive answer as “personhood” is not a rigidly definable concept and, in fact, has varied between different societies and over time. Some societies / religions view personhood occurring at conception. Other societies have defined personhood as occurring at various times</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>following</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">birth, such as ancient Sparta where newborns were examined by local elders and if found wanting were thrown over a cliff. Today such a practice sounds barbaric but to those living in ancient Sparta the newborn wasn’t truly a Spartan until the local elder pronounced the child to be one.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Just as there is no definitive test to determine where “personhood” begins, there is no such test to determine whether an AI is truly intelligent (Strong AI), and therefor presumably deserving of rights, or whether it simply “mimics” intelligent behavior (Weak AI). This point is succinctly made in the film “2001: A Space Odyssey” when a BBC reporter asks Astronaut Dave Bowman whether HAL has genuine emotions. Dave responds: “Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions. Of course, he’s programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him. But as to whether or not he has real feelings is something I don’t think anyone can truthfully answer.”</font></font></p>

Passing the test does not require an ability to see, to hear, or to speak. It does not require the ability to perform physical tasks, such as riding a bike or playing a musical instrument. What is required is that the machine be capable of reasoning in a manner similar to humans and of communicating in a human language, such as English. While the fictional computer HAL of “2001: A Space Odyssey” could easily pass such a test, no real computer has ever even come close.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">While it is often difficult to precisely define the moment that a new field of endeavor springs into existence, a defining event in the emergence of AI as a formal academic discipline was certainly the Dartmouth Conference of 1956. This conference is credited with coining the term “artificial intelligence”. It was attended by a number of individuals, such as John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Claude Shannon who went on to be become the ‘founding fathers’ of the field.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The Dartmouth Conference is also noteworthy for giving rise to what has to be one of the worst time and effort estimates ever generated by a group of experts in the history of Man. Essentially the organizers of the conference believed that a group of ten carefully chosen scientists working together over the summer of 1956 could accomplish the goals now associated with AI. Over ½ a century later, working with machines that are billions of times more powerful, we have yet to achieve many of the goals these visionaries first thought they would be able to tackle in a two month summer project.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">As evidenced by the Dartmouth Conference, in the early days of computing, there was much optimism that computers would attain general intelligence in a reasonably short period of time.</span><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><br /></font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This optimism was bolstered by an impressive array of accomplishments that were rapidly achieved. In the late 1950’s, Arthur Samuel wrote a checkers playing program that could learn from its mistakes and thus, over time, become better at playing the game. There was much excitement when the program eventually became better than its creator at the game. Other AI programs developed in the late 1950’s and 1960’s include Logic Theorist (1956) by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, which could prove simple mathematical theorems, SAINT (1963) by Jim Slagle which could solve calculus problems, and STUDENT (1967) by Daniel Bobrow which could solve word-based algebra problems.</font></font></p>

      Figure 14.6: A retrospective of some of the early successes made by AI researchers in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s. These scenes are taken from the 1992 PBS series “The Machine That Changed The World”, episode four “The Thinking Machine”.

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Much of the work in this period was based on variations of the search techniques and formal logics discussed in Section 14.3.1 and 14.3.2. What researchers soon discovered, however, was that the techniques they used to achieve their impressive results on small, limited problems could not be scaled up to attack more substantial problems. This was due to the underlying exponential nature of the search spaces associated with these problems. When one is dealing with a very small problem, such as searching a maze for an exit, the “brute force” approach of exhaustively testing every possible solution path is feasible. This approach, however, cannot be applied to larger problems, such as communicating in a natural language, where there are billions upon billions of potential solution paths.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">For these reasons, the methods that were explored in the late 1950’s and 1960’s have become known as</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>weak general methods</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">. They are “general” in that they can be applied to a wide variety of problems. Yet they are “weak” in the sense that they cannot directly solve problems of substantial size in any area.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The way around the problem of exponential search spaces appeared to be the application of knowledge to limit the amount of searching required to reach a solution. In other words, if a program had a way to recognize which solution paths looked most promising, substantial amounts of time could be saved by exploring these paths first. This idea was formalized as a heuristic. A</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>heuristic</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is a “rule of thumb” which is usually true. For example, a heuristic for the game of checkers is: “it is better to have more pieces on the board than your opponent.” While this is not always true (e.g., you have more pieces but they are in terrible positions and will be lost on the next move), it is usually true. Other heuristics drawn from everyday life are: bright red apples are tasty, milk with a more distant expiration date is fresher than milk with a closer expiration date, jobs with higher salaries are more desirable than jobs with lower salaries.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Originally, AI programs had very little knowledge. They depended primarily on searching through a huge number of alternatives to find an acceptable solution. Over time, however, the emphasis switched from developing better search strategies to developing structures for encoding and applying knowledge to solve problems. One such structure, called a</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>script</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, is used for representing knowledge about stereotypical situations, such as what happens at a birthday party or when one goes out to see a movie. A similar structure, called a</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>frame</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, is used for representing knowledge about objects.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">During the 1970’s many AI researchers began developing and testing strategies for knowledge representation and manipulation. As was the case in the 1950’s and 1960’s, their implementation efforts generally focused on small, limited problems, which came to be known as</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>micro-worlds</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One of the most impressive early examples of a micro-world was Terry Winograd’s program SHRDLU. SHRDLU, developed in 1972, simulated a world filled with blocks, pyramids, and boxes together with a robot arm that could manipulate those objects. What made SHRDLU so unique for its time was that a human could tell the robot arm what to do by typing commands in ordinary English, such as “Find a block which is taller than the one you are holding and put it in the box.” As this example illustrates, the system was capable of understanding some of the more subtle features of English such as pronoun reference. SHRDLU also understood simple “physics” concepts, such as: “two different objects cannot occupy the same physical space at the same time” and “if you release an object it will fall to the ground unless some other object is directly supporting it” and even “a cube cannot be supported by a pyramid”.</font></font></p>

      Figure 14.7: Terry Winograd interacting with SHRDLU. This scene is taken from the 1992 PBS series “The Machine That Changed The World”, episode four “The Thinking Machine”.

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">SHRDLU showed that programs could converse “intelligently” with humans in English, if they were provided with a thorough knowledge of the world being discussed and the rules that governed what was possible in such a world. Although SHRDLU-like natural language interfaces were used in the text-based adventure games of the 1980’s and early 1990’s, the approaches employed by SHRDLU and similar programs to reason about their micro-worlds could not be easily scaled up to handle the vast amounts of knowledge necessary to make sense of the real world.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">As AI researchers began to recognize these obstacles, the early optimism of the 1950’s and 60’s gave way to a period of retrenchment in the 1970’s. Much of the government support and funding that had been lavished on AI in the early days dwindled during this time. The frustration of the AI researchers was that while they could create programs capable of impressive feats in very limited and focused areas, their techniques did not work well on the large, poorly defined problems that characterize the real world.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One of the breakthroughs of the early 1980’s was the widespread realization that micro-worlds could be constructed to represent small but important aspects of human knowledge. Much of the knowledge that is valued in our world is specialized knowledge – knowledge that is possessed by only a small fraction of the human population – such as knowledge of finance, medicine, and law. Even within these fields people further specialize into subfields such as corporate tax law or neuromedicine.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Many of these highly specialized, highly valuable, areas of human knowledge can be modeled by expert systems.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Expert systems</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">are computer programs that behave at or near (or even above) the level of a human expert in a narrowly defined problem domain, such as certain kinds of stock market transactions or credit card fraud detection. Expert systems focus on micro-worlds. But instead of being micro-worlds about simple domains of little intellectual or monetary value, they concern scarce and valuable information.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">While the 1980’s was the decade in which expert systems began to become commercially viable, their roots extend as far back as the late 1960’s. In 1969, Ed Feigenbaum, Bruce Buchanan, and Joshua Lederberg developed the DENDRAL program at Stanford. DENDRAL could determine the structure of molecules from their chemical formula (e.g., H</font></font><sub><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">2</font></font></sub><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">O) and the results of a mass spectrometer reading. The first</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>rule-based</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">expert system was MYCIN by Feigenbaum, Buchanan, and Edward Shortliffe. MYCIN, which was developed in the mid 1970’s, was capable of diagnosing blood infections based on the results of various medical tests. The MYCIN system was able to perform as well as some infectious blood disease experts and better than non-specialist doctors.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">With the emergence of expert systems in the 1980’s, there was renewed interest in artificial intelligence. Governments and corporations once again began heavily funding AI research. This time the goal was not to construct a general-purpose intelligence, but instead to develop practical commercial systems.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A large number of expert systems in fields ranging from financial services to medicine were implemented during this period. While many of these systems proved practical and cost effective, many did not. AI researchers tended to underestimate the difficulty of acquiring and encoding human expertise into the rule-based form required by expert system software. In some fields, it was found that the costs of acquiring and encoding expert knowledge could not be justified due to factors such as the rate at which knowledge in certain fields changed or the size of the potential target market. In other fields, such as credit card fraud detection, expert systems have become fully integrated into the way organizations do business and are no longer even thought of as “an AI application”.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Expert systems, by their very nature, are limited to small problems. They focus on capturing what has come to be called surface knowledge.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Surface knowledge</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">consists of the simple rules that generally characterize reasoning in a particular area. For example, the rule “If mild fever and nasal discharge then cold” could be part of a basic medical expert system. The type of knowledge captured by these rules is far different from a deep understanding of the field, which requires knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and the germ theory of medicine. While MYCIN was excellent at diagnosing blood infections, it had no understanding of this deeper knowledge. In fact, MYCIN didn’t even know what a patient was or what it means to be alive or dead.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In addition to being constrained to surface knowledge, expert systems suffer from two other major limitations. One is that they do not learn. Humans must hand-code each of the rules that form the knowledge base of an expert system. These rules are fixed. They do not change over time. Hence, when particular rules are no longer valid, humans must recognize this situation and update the knowledge base. Otherwise, the expert system will provide dated advice.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Expert systems also tend to be quite brittle. AI researchers use the word</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>brittle</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">to mean that when presented with a problem that does not fit neatly into their area of expertise, an expert system will often give completely inappropriate advice. This problem is made more vexing by the fact that few expert systems are able to determine when they are being asked to give advice on problems that are outside their area of expertise.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Artificial intelligence research went through yet another sea change in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s. As the limitations of expert systems began to become apparent, attention turned to the much-neglected topic of machine learning – particularly neural networks.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Neural networks</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, or connectionist architectures, consist of a large number of very simple processors which are interconnected via a network of communications channels, where each channel has an adjustable strength or weight associated with it. Neural networks are modeled (very loosely) on the brain – each processor represents a neuron (a brain cell), each weighted interconnection a synapse (the connections between brain cells). The knowledge contained in a network is encoded in the weights associated with the connections. The most astonishing feature of neural networks is that humans do not directly program them, instead they learn by example.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The neural network model of computing is discussed in Section 14.3.3. In this section we confine ourselves to a few words about the history of this subject.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts proposed a simple model of artificial neurons in which each neuron would be either “on” or “off”. The artificial neurons had two kinds of inputs “excitatory” and “inhibitory.” The neuron would “fire” – switch to “on” when the total number of excitatory inputs exceeded the number of inhibitory inputs.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">McCulloch and Pitts were able to prove that their networks were equivalent in computational power to general-purpose computers. John Von Neumann showed that redundancies could be added to McCulloch-Pitts networks to enable them to continue to function reliably in spite of the malfunction of individual elements. While these early neural networks were certainly interesting, they were of limited practical value, since the network interconnections had to be set by hand – no one knew how they could be made to learn.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Work by Frank Rosenblatt in the 1950’s and early 1960’s overcame the learning problem to some degree. Rosenblatt proposed the</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>perceptron</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, a single-layer, feed-forward network of artificial neurons together with a learning algorithm. He was able to prove that his learning algorithm could be used to teach a perceptron to recognize anything it was capable of representing simply by presenting it with a sufficient number of examples.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This was a very important result, and led to much excitement. Perceptrons were built and trained to recognize all manner of things during the 1960’s. One famous example was a perceptron for distinguishing “males” from “females” by examining photos of peoples’ faces.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Research into artificial neural networks came to an abrupt halt in the early 1970’s. Many people credit</font></font><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="../Text/FootNotes.html#sdfootnote14sym" id="sdfootnote14anc"><sup>6</sup></a> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert’s 1969 book</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Perceptrons</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">with bringing about the end of research into neural network based machine learning for nearly a decade and a half. Minsky and Papert proved that while it is true that perceptrons can learn anything they are capable of representing, the fact is that they are actually capable of representing very little. The most often cited example is that a perceptron with two inputs cannot learn to distinguish when its inputs are the same from when they are different. In other words, a perceptron cannot represent the exclusive-or,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>xor</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, operation of Chapter 12.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Minsky and Papert’s proofs only applied to perceptrons, single-layered neural networks not multiple-layer networks. However, at the time, single-layered networks were the only kind of neural networks that computer scientists had a learning algorithm for. In other words, the situation in the early 1970’s was that AI researchers knew that neural networks could, in theory, compute anything that a general-purpose computer could. But, the only kind of neural networks that they had a learning algorithm for (perceptrons) could not compute many basic functions.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In the late 1980’s and 1990’s many AI researchers began returning attention to neural networks. A number of groups independently developed the “back-propagation” learning algorithm. This algorithm allows multiple-layer feed-forward networks to be trained. The good news was that these networks, given a sufficient number of processing units, could represent any computable function. The bad news was that back-propagation, unlike the learning rule for perceptrons, does not guarantee an answer will be found simply because it exists. In other words, back-propagation does not</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>guarantee</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">that a multilayer network will be able to learn a particular concept regardless of how many examples it is given or how much time is spent going over these examples. In many cases, however, the algorithm does enable the network to successfully learn the concept.</font></font></p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Neural networks and other approaches to machine learning also suffer in comparison to the symbolic approach to machine intelligence in that they are often unable to explain or justify their conclusions. The practical result is that one can never really be sure that the network has been trained to recognize what was intended.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There is a humorous story from the early days of machine learning about a network that was supposed to be trained to recognize tanks hidden in forest regions. The network was trained on a large set of photographs – some with tanks and some without tanks. After learning was complete the system appeared to work well when “shown” additional photographs from the original set. As a final test, a new group of photos were taken to see if the network could recognize tanks in a slightly different setting. The results were extremely disappointing. No one was sure why the network failed on this new group of photos. Eventually, someone noticed that in the original set of photos the network had been trained on, all of the photos with tanks had been taken on a cloudy day, while all of the photos without tanks were taken on a sunny day. The network had not learned to detect the difference between scenes with tanks and without tanks, it had instead learned to distinguish photos taken on cloudy days from photos taken on sunny days!</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Computer Scientists use the term</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>big data</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">to describe the extremely large datasets that are becoming available in a wide variety of disciplines, such as genomics, social networks, astronomy, Internet text and documents, and atmospheric science – to name but a few. Big data is often characterized as high volume (very large datasets), high velocity (the data changes rapidly), and/or high variety (large range of data types and sources of data).</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Statistical machine learning techniques</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">refer to methods, or techniques, that apply statistical models to large amounts of data in order to enable machines to automatically infer relationships from the patterns that can be found in the data. There are a number of statistical inference models used in machine learning but one of the most popular is called</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Bayesian inference</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Note that while statistical machine learning techniques differ from the neural networks mentioned in Section 14.2.4 above, they are both sub-disciplines of machine learning – they are both trained on large data sets and learn to recognize patterns present in the data. The major difference between the two is that neural networks are inspired by biological neural systems and the feedback cycles that appear to be inherent to those systems, while statistical machine learning techniques have grown out of mathematics and statistics rather than biology. Neural networks were once the most popular machine learning model but since the turn of the century statistical methods have become dominant.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Until relatively recently, progress had been quite limited on a number of important problems in AI. For example, the traditional symbolic AI approach to translating documents from one language to another proved ineffective.</font></font>&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There are simply too many exceptions to the ‘rules’ governing how humans use languages for it to be practical to try to capture them all. Many computer scientists thought that computers to would need to master common sense knowledge, in order to ‘understand’ what was being said, before substantial progress could be made. What big data and statistical machine learning techniques have shown us is that given enough data many of these problems can be solved to a large degree, absent deep understanding, by looking for patterns in the data.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">To use an example you may be familiar with, let’s look at Google Translate. Google Translate learns to translate documents between two languages, say English and French, by first comparing millions of documents, such as books and web sites, which humans have already translated. These document pairs are scanned for statistically significant patterns. The billions of patterns generated by this process can then be used to translate new documents between the two languages. Given enough source data the resulting translations, while not perfect, are usually “good enough” for the reader to understand the ideas the writer is attempting to communicate.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In the Google approach humans are not directly teaching the computers how to translate documents. Instead, humans have taught the computers how to compare documents and look for statistically significant patterns. We humans then give these computers millions of pairs of already translated documents. The computers then figure out which input patterns (say in French) are most likely to be associated to which output patterns (say in English). When presented with some new input text in French, the system produces the most likely English output pattern associated with that text.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It is very important to understand that</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i><b>Google Translate has no understanding of what the words and sentences it translates actually mean</b></i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, it simply replaces one string of text with another string of text based on statistical patterns derived from human translated documents.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><br /></font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Communicating with computers by speaking with them has long been the Holy Grail of artificial intelligence. However, after more than 50 years of effort, the capabilities of the HAL computer from “2001: A Space Odyssey” remain stubbornly out of reach. Within the past decade or so, substantial progress has been made on parts of the problem – specifically in the disciplines of speech recognition, speech synthesis, and question answering systems.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Speech recognition</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">refers to the automatic conversion of human speech into text, while</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>speech synthesis</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">focuses on the automatic generation of human speech from text. As such, speech recognition and speech synthesis applications are complimentary in nature. They often form the first and last steps in voice-based search and question answering systems (such as that available in Google Now) or virtual assistant systems (such as Siri).</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Speech recognition systems can be characterized along three different dimensions: the size of the vocabulary recognized by the system, whether or not the system is speaker dependent or independent, and whether the system supports continuous speech or is limited to discrete utterances.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Vocabulary size</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">refers to the number of words or phrases the system can recognize. In general, the larger the vocabulary the more difficult the recognition problem becomes. A system that is limited to recognizing “yes” and “no” is rather easy to construct, while systems designed to recognize hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of words become progressively more difficult to build. A system’s</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>recognition rate</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is the percentage of utterances that the system is capable of correctly identifying. Often a system’s recognition rate would dramatically decrease as vocabulary sizes increased – especially in earlier systems. Background noise and other factors can also significantly influence a system’s recognition rate.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A system is said to be</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Speaker independent</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">if it is intended to be used by a general audience – its ability to recognize utterances is independent of who is speaking.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Speaker dependent</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">systems, on the other hand, must be trained to recognize an individual’s voice. Training usually consists of having the speaker read aloud a number of pre-selected text passages while the computer listens to the speaker’s voice. Once trained, only that individual can use the system.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Human speech is continuous, in that we don’t pause between each individual word. We are often unaware of this fact since we are so good at speech recognition – we tend to “hear” the individual words, even when they are spoken as a continuous stream. To see this, think of the last time you heard someone speaking in a language that is foreign to you. Didn’t it seem that they were just producing a stream of sounds and not a sequence of words? In fact, one of the hardest things about learning to understand a foreign language is just picking out the individual words.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Continuous utterance recognition</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">systems allow people to speak naturally without inserting pauses between words, whereas</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Discrete utterance recognition</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">systems require speakers insert brief pauses between each spoken word or phrase. Humans find speaking in this way very unnatural.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Today’s end-consumer facing speech recognition systems tend to be large vocabulary, speaker independent, continuous utterance systems. Most anyone can use them immediately without first training the system to understand their voice, and speakers can say pretty much whatever they want, while speaking in a natural voice.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Such systems are a relatively recent advance. Prior to the release of Google’s voice search in late 2008, most speech recognition systems had to compromise on one of the three primary features. So, for example you could have a speaker dependent, large vocabulary, continuous utterance system – which required the speaker to train the system before use; or a speaker independent, small vocabulary, continuous utterance system – which anyone could use but could only recognize a limited number of words and phrases; or even a speaker independent, large vocabulary, discrete utterance system – which anyone could use but… required…. a…. pause… between… each…. word…</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">As was the case with machine translations, recent advances in speech recognition are due in large part to rise of big data (the availability of lots and lots of examples of spoken text) and statistical machine learning techniques. Most speech recognition programs model human speech production using a formal mathematical model called a Hidden Markov Model.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Markov Model</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, or Markov Chain, is a system that consists of a number of discrete states where the probably of being in a particular state at a particular time is dependent on the previous state and likelihood of transitioning between that state and the current one. Individual states in the model generate outputs with some probability. In a</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Hidden Markov Model</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(HMM) the sequences of transitions between states in the underlying Markov Model are not visible but the outputs produced by those transitions are. HMM’s enable one to determine the most likely sequence of states that were traversed in the underlying system based solely on the observed output. HMM are useful in speech recognition programs since all we are able to observe are the sounds that were produced (the output) and we wish to infer the underlying (hidden) sequence of words that produced those sounds.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Understanding a spoken human language, like English, involves solving at least two separate problems. The first problem, which we have been discussing so far, is recognizing the individual spoken words. The second problem, known as</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>semantics</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, involves comprehending the meaning of those words.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Using big data, machine learning techniques, and Hidden Markov Models computer scientists and engineers have made good progress on the first problem – recognizing the individual spoken words. Much less progress has been made on the second problem – understanding the meaning of the words.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Thus far, creating systems that can truly comprehend general spoken (or written) English is not currently possible. However, reasonable results can often be achieved if the topic of conversation is narrowly focused and task oriented.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One way of judging our progress to date in giving computers the ability to use language intelligently is to look at the evolution of voice-based search and the rise of ‘intelligent’ assistants. Such a review can also help us understand the limitations of our present tools and techniques.</font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The first large-scale general purpose (speaker independent, large vocabulary, continuous utterance) deployment of speech recognition technology intended for a wide audience was Google’s voice-based web search.</font></font></font>&nbsp;<font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Released in 2008 for Android and iPhone smart phones, this technology enabled one to speak a search query, rather than type. While remarkably impressive for its time, Google voice search simply returned a web page of Google search results – exactly as if the speaker had typed the search query.</font></font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Two years later, in 2010, Google extended this technology to enable Android phones to perform simple actions based on spoken input.</font><font style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">For example, the updated system made it possible to send a text message or email to someone on your contact list by speaking the request (e.g., “Send text message to Mike O’Neal. Wow! AI has a come a long way in a little over 50 years.”). Other actions included calling the phone number of a business by name (e.g., “Call Johnny’s Pizza in Ruston Louisiana”), getting directions (e.g., “Navigate to Louisiana Tech University”), or finding and playing music. This technology required the system to have some limited understanding of what the speaker was asking the phone to do. The implementation was straightforward as the system simply listened for special keywords, such as “navigate”, and then launched the appropriate application passing it any specified parameters, such as “Louisiana Tech University”, when the keyword was detected.</font></font></font></p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Apple followed suit a year later in the fall of 2011 with the introduction of Siri for the</font></font></font> <font size="3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">iPhone 4S.</font><font style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Siri, billed as a “personal assistant”, could handle a wider range of tasks than Google Voice Actions and provided for a more natural spoken interface. The interface was far less rigid and didn’t require the speaker to remember particular keywords. So, for example, instead needing to say something precise like “Navigate to Louisiana Tech University” one could say “Show me how to get to Louisiana Tech” or “Give me directions to Louisiana Tech”, etc.</font></font><br /></p>

    <div>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Another big innovation was that Siri implemented</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">the ability to respond verbally to some tasks. For example, you could ask Siri “What’s my schedule like for tomorrow?” and ‘she’ would access your calendar and go through your list of appointments for the next day. Siri could also schedule an appointment for you and even notify you of conflicts with existing appointments. The system also possessed the ability to verbally respond to a very limited range of factual question about time and the weather, such as “What time is it in London?” or “Will it rain tomorrow?”.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Since weather varies by location, in order to correctly answer such questions Siri needs to know the location to which the user is referring. Unless we explicitly state a location, when we ask such a question we generally mean “right here” – which Siri can determine from the iPhone’s GPS or cell tower triangulation. However, the implied location can change depending on the context of the conversation. Siri is smart enough to know that when you ask it “What time is it in London?” followed immediately by “What will the weather be like tomorrow?” – you are probably referring to the weather in London, England. Similarly, if you ask “What will the weather be like in Paris tomorrow?” followed immediately by “in Rome?” it knows from the context of the conversation that the phrase “in Rome?” means “What will the weather be like in Rome tomorrow?”</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In order to successfully answer these kinds of questions it is necessary for Siri to possess a rudimentary understanding of conversation and context – something absent from the original version of Google Voice Actions.</font></font></p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Apple further improved Siri with the release of the iPhone 5 in September 2012. &nbsp;</font></font><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The revised version of Siri included expanded knowledge of sports and entertainment allowing the system to verbally respond to a wider range of question. For example, in response to “Who is Drew Brees?” Siri replied “Drew Brees currently plays quarterback for the Saints.” while showing me his picture and player stats. Despite this rather impressive result, the vast majority of questions posed to Siri (as of late 2013) generally return web pages, from either a Google search or Wolfram Alpha query.</span></p>

After receiving the clue, Watson would decompose it into key words and phrases and then simultaneously runs thousands of language analysis algorithms to find statistically related phrases in its repository of stored text (obtained from reference books, web sites, and Wikipedia). Watson then compared these thousands of different results, filtering against clues in the question category (such as the answer is probably a city) to select its final answer – generally the most popular result (the one returned by the greatest number of algorithms). The process, which is far more complex than that used by Google Now and Siri, is often called</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>deep question answering</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Broadly speaking,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Computer vision</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is the branch of computer science which aims to give computers the ability to see. Achieving computer vision has long been one of the goals of artificial intelligence researchers. In the early days it was through that this problem shouldn’t be too difficult, as one could simply attach a camera to a computer. There were even some early successes, such as the perceptrons that could distinguish male faces from female faces (which we discussed in Section 14.2.4). Unfortunately teaching a computer to recognize various objects in the real world from different angles and under different lighting conditions is far, far harder than distinguishing men from women based solely on still photographs of front facing ‘head shots’.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One of the first computer vision projects, called Freddy, was conducted at the University of Edinburgh under the direction of Donald Michie from 1969 through 1976. In its initial version (1969-1971) Freddy consisted of a camera overlooking a rotating platform on which common objects, such as a cup, were placed. The camera was hooked to a computer that attempted to recognize the objects on the platform. The system was later expanded in the 1973 to 1976 timeframe as Freddy II. The second iteration of Freddy included a robot arm that could manipulate objects and be programmed to perform simple tasks like putting together a toy car from various parts – the car body, four wheels, and two axles. While Freddy was able to recognize, under carefully controlled conditions, the objects it had been programmed to detect, the process was quite slow, taking several minutes on some objects. The methods used to program Freddy couldn’t be effectively scaled up to larger numbers of objects or ‘real world’ lighting and viewing conditions.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">While we humans are very good at recognizing an immense number of objects under widely varying lighting conditions and viewing angles this problem is still beyond the capabilities of today’s computer systems. Nonetheless, computer vision systems have slowly improved over the years and in specialized domains are beginning to become rather impressive.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One computer vision application you might be familiar with is Google Goggles.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Google Goggles</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is an application that uses the camera on your smart phone (Android or iPhone) to take a picture and then send it to Google’s servers where computer vision algorithms search the image to determine whether it contains any recognizable objects. The system works best on product logos, works of art, text, and famous landmarks. Food, cars, plants, and animals are examples of objects that Goggles can’t recognize.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Another application of computer vision that you may have heard of is facial recognition.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Facial recognition systems</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">are applications that focus on automatically identifying an individual from a digit image by taking that image, extracting relevant features, and then comparing those features against a database of known individuals.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">While these systems are used by counter-terrorism and law enforcement officials, they do not (yet) work nearly as well as they are generally portrayed in movies and on television. Today’s facial recognition systems tend to give the most accurate results when presented with high resolution images where the subject is evenly lit, and looking directly towards the camera. Thus, their effectiveness can be quite limited in ‘real world’ situations where the lighting, viewing angle, and video quality cannot be easily controlled. Despite recent advances in facial recognition systems, these systems were unable to determine the identity of the suspects in the April 15</font></font><sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">th</font></font></sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, 2013 Boston Marathon bombing – even after authorities spotted the individuals in video surveillance footage.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Today the most wide spread consumer facing implementation of computer vision is found in Microsoft’s Kinect.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Kinect</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is a sensor system that allows Xbox game machines to, in a limited sense, see – to recognize and identify players from their facial features and to track their movements in real time.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Kinect was first announced in June of 2009 at E3 (the Electronic Entertainment Expo) under the name “Project Natal”.</font><font style="font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Project Natal promised to combine motion tracking of individual players, facial recognition, voice control (speech recognition), and video conferencing into a mass produced inexpensive (under $200) consumer product.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">About a year and a half later, in November 2010, the first version of Kinect for Xbox360 was released. While the initial version of Kinect was a revolutionary product that achieved many of the goals set out in the original 2009 “product vision” announcement, it did come with a number of limitations. These limitations included: the ability to motion track only two individuals at a time, facial recognition that often didn’t work well in the typical lighting environments found in a home, and voice control that wasn’t very reliable in noisy environments.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">As an early adopter of Kinect, this author can confirm that the original Kinect had problems recognizing and logging me in under many common lighting and distance situations (e.g., sitting on my couch when lit from behind) and the voice controls were much less reliable than when using Siri or Google Voice Search (circa 2012-2013). “Waking up” the system with a wave of the hand also felt awkward in many situations. Of course, making these complaints about a 1</font></font><sup><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">st</font></font></sup> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">generation product that was the first to bring a working implementation of computer vision technology to a mass audience seems somewhat petty.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In late 2013 Microsoft released the second iteration of Kinect as an integral part of their Xbox One launch.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The second version of Kinect overcame many of the problems associated with the original Kinect: the 3-D depth sensor has a higher resolution in version 2 of Kinect, the 2-D color camera now supports 1080p resolution (instead of 640 by 480 in the original version), and the system now includes an active IR (Infra Red) camera that allows Kinect to see in the dark, overcoming the problems associated with illumination that the original Kinect suffered from. Skeletal tracking has improved: up to six individuals can be tracked simultaneously (instead of only two), with more articulation points per person (25 joints, including wrist and thumb tracking, up from 20 joints per person in the original version), and a new physics model allows the system to estimate the amount of force behind a movement. Version 2 of Kinect can also perform attention and mood estimation by looking at a player’s head orientation and facial features. It does this by tracking whether a player’s head and eyes are looking in the direction of the Kinect or not, and whether he or she is smiling or frowning. The system is even able to estimate the heart rate of the individuals it is tracking by detecting the very slight flushing that our faces undergo with each heart beat.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Despite being a truly impressive innovation, it is important to clearly understand that</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i><b>Kinect doesn’t “see” in the same sense that humans do</b></i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">. Essentially Kinect is blind to most things in range of its sensors other than people’s faces and their bodies. What I mean by this is that Kinect possesses an internal ‘skeletal model’ of people’s joints and how those joints can move. It then looks for groupings of pixels in the images it is recording that appear to be moving in ways that match its internal model of how humans move. When it finds pixels moving in this way, it then tracks them. The result is a system that tracks human movement. Likewise, the system has a model of the way human faces are constructed and how they can move – smile, frown, close their eyes, etc. As with full body motion tracking, the system looks for pixels in configurations that match human faces, it can then crudely track a person’s facial features and even identify individuals it has been trained to recognize. Kinect doesn’t recognize cats, or coffee tables, or cups, or couches, or most anything else – it is limited to people’s faces and their bodies.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Another problem that AI researchers have struggled with for many decades is the concept of constructing autonomous vehicles. An</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>autonomous vehicle</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is one that is capable of directing its own movements while avoiding obstacles and obeying the rules, both implicit and explicit, that govern such vehicles. Progress in this field can be seen over the past 40 years by looking at three separate projects: the Stanford Cart from the 1970’s, the CMU self-driving van from the early 1990’s, and today’s Google self-driving car.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One of the first autonomous vehicles to be constructed was the Stanford Cart, a product of SAIL (the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory). The</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Stanford Cart</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">was a golf cart sized battery powered autonomous vehicle with an onboard camera and wireless connection to a large computer. The cart was designed to record video images and send those images to the computer for processing. The computer would analyze the images, determine how the cart should move, and transmit movement commands back to the vehicle. The cart would then execute the commands in order to move a few feet forward and the process would repeat itself. By the late 1970’s Hans Moravec, who was a graduate student at Stanford at the time, managed to bring the cart to a level where it was able to successfully navigate a large, 100 foot, room while avoiding chairs and other obstacles. Crossing the room required five hours.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">By the early 1990’s, nearly 20 years after Moravec began his work on the Stanford Cart, autonomous vehicle technology had progressed to the point where Carnegie Mellon University had developed a large van that could slowly drive itself down a road. The vehicle used a neural network approach, called ALVINN (Autonomous Land Vehicle in a Neural Network), that was trained by monitoring a human driver. Essentially, the vehicle’s cameras could detect the center line and edge of the road and the neural net kept the van between the lines. Changing lighting and weather conditions required the network to be retrained.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Today, 20 years or so past the CMU self-driving van, when people think of autonomous vehicles the Google self-driving car is generally what comes to mind. The Google self-driving car was originally developed as a research project at SAIL (the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) – the same organization that gave rise to the Stanford Cart 40 years earlier. Sebastian Thrun led this project.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The Google self-driving car utilizes a number of advanced sensors including a laser range finder mounted to the top of the car that incorporates 64 laser beams and spins to produce a 360 degree 3D map of the car’s surroundings. Other sensors include: four radars mounted in the bumpers – two on the front bumper, two on the rear bumper – that are used for detecting other vehicles so the car can safely merge into traffic; a camera mounted near the rear view mirror for detecting traffic lights; GPS for location tracking; and an inertial measurement unit and wheel encoder to determine speed and distance traveled. The car uses these sensors together with high resolution maps to safely navigate while obeying traffic laws and avoiding obstacles.</font></font></p>

While this is not a ‘slick’ video, it does present a very good overview of how the Google self-driving car actually works.</span><!--EndFragment-->&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In August 2012 Google blogged that it had about a dozen self-driving cars in service at any one time and that it had completed over 300,000 miles of testing without “a single accident under computer control”.</font></font><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="../Text/FootNotes.html#sdfootnote32sym" id="sdfootnote32anc"><sup>7</sup></a> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">About a year earlier, in August of 2011 there was a widely reported “fender bender” involving a Google self-driving car, but Google claims that the car was being driven under human control at the time.</font></font><sup><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="../Text/FootNotes.html#sdfootnote33sym" id="sdfootnote33anc">8</a></sup></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">While the Google self-driving car is an amazing device there are a number of issues that must be resolved before self-driving cars become commonplace. First, there are still some outstanding technical hurdles that need to be overcome. Google’s self-driving car cannot reliably handle driving through snow – as it temporarily changes the landscape. Similarly, road construction and other situations in which the car’s built-in maps are rendered inaccurate are problematic. The car also can not presently handle situations in which a cop or other human is directing traffic.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In addition to the technical issues, there is the question of cost. Google estimates that each self-driving car contains approximately $150,000 worth of extra equipment. With mass production the cost of the sensors will decrease dramatically, but even an order of magnitude decrease (factor of 10) would still result in a self-driving option costing $15,000 – pricing such a system out of the reach of most individuals.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Finally, there are the questions of the liability and licensing that must be addressed. Who will be judged at fault when a self-driving car is involved in an accident? What happens when someone is seriously hurt or killed? For many years this author felt that the liability issues would prevent self-driving cars from ever becoming a widespread reality. My thinking on this matter has evolved recently. I now believe that there will be significant pressure from the insurance industry and public safety groups which will provide an effective counterbalance to the inevitable liability litigation that will occur.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Once these remaining obstacles are overcome, the public good that is likely to flow from self-driving vehicles, in reduced highway fatalities and other social benefits, will be immense.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One of the earliest ideas in the quest for machine intelligence – and one that is still used today – is the modeling of decision making as state space search. A</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>state space</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is a collection of three things:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">1.A way to represent the state of some system at a particular moment in time, by a compact description of the important characteristics of that system.</span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">2.&nbsp;A way to determine the legal moves, or transitions, between states of the system.</span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">3.&nbsp;A test to recognize when the goal has been achieved. It is also sometimes necessary to have a separate test to recognize a loss – i.e., a situation from which the goal can never be reached.</span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Suppose we wanted to model a board game, such as chess or checkers, using a state space. First, we would need a way to represent the configuration of the game at any point in time. For a board game, this could consist of a simple two-dimensional grid, or array, containing symbols to represent the position of each player’s pieces. Next, we would need a description of the rules that apply to moving pieces in the game. For board games, such as chess, these are simply the rules that describe the basic movements of each piece (e.g., the rook may be moved any number of unoccupied squares forward or backward or left or right.). While these rules differ from game to game, they are generally quite simple and can be easily mastered. Finally, a test to recognize a winning situation would be necessary. In chess this would amount to a description of checkmate applied to your opponent. Checkmate, applied to your side, also functions as the loss test so that you can know when to quit playing.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Once the game, or problem, has been described in terms of a state space, making a move can be modeled as searching through the space of all possible moves. While algorithms, such as</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>mini-max</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, exist for doing this in two player games, like checkers and chess, we will concentrate on single player games to illustrate the main concepts.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The Farmer, Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage puzzle is a simple one player “game” in which the player attempts to determine how a farmer can transport a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river using a small boat that can only hold the farmer and one other object. What makes the puzzle somewhat challenging is that if the farmer leaves either the wolf alone with the goat or the goat alone with the cabbage, one will be eaten by the other. If the farmer is present, then he will keep the participants from eating one another. Figure 14.2 illustrates the first few moves a human player might try.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Initially all of the participants are on the west bank of the river. The goal is to have all participants on the east bank. The illustration shows the effect of three river crossings.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">First, the farmer takes the goat (and himself) across the river leaving the wolf alone with the cabbage. Since wolves are carnivores, the cabbage will not be eaten.</font></font><a class="sdfootnoteanc" href="../Text/FootNotes.html#sdfootnote35sym" id="sdfootnote35anc"><sup>9</sup></a> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Arriving at the east bank, the farmer leaves the goat and begins his second crossing, this time back to the west bank. When the farmer arrives at the west bank he places the wolf into the boat and begins his third crossing. Upon arrival at the east bank, the farmer, wolf, and goat are where we want them to be, but the cabbage is still on the west bank.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">What should the farmer do next? Clearly, he can’t leave the wolf alone with the goat or he will be sorely disappointed when he returns with the cabbage. Perhaps it was a mistake to bring the wolf over to the east bank, but if he had brought the cabbage instead he would still be faced with a similar problem – if he left the goat and cabbage alone together, the goat would eat the cabbage.</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0in;">Figure 14.25:<br />
          The Farmer, Wolf, Goat and Cabbage Problem</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In order to see how this problem can be solved, let’s map it to a state space. First, we need a way to represent the state of the system at any point in time. Clearly, the important information is the location of each of the four participants, and there are only three locations mentioned in the puzzle: the west bank, the east bank, and the boat.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">None of the four participants are in the boat at the start of the problem. None are required to be in the boat at the conclusion of the problem. In fact, the boat is used simply as a conveyance for moving the farmer, and at most one other object, back and forth between the banks of the river. Hence, it isn’t really necessary to model the boat as a place in order to solve this problem.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This leaves only the east bank and the west bank of the river as potential locations for the participants. The state of the problem can therefore be modeled by an ordered list of four values. The first value gives the location of the farmer, either w for west bank or e for east bank. The second value is the location of the wolf. The third value is the location of the goat, and the fourth value is the location of the cabbage. Hence, the state of the problem at any point in time will look like:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">( &lt;side for farmer&gt;, &lt;side for wolf&gt;, &lt;side for goat&gt;, &lt;side for cabbage&gt; )</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The problem begins with all of the participants on the west bank of the river:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(w, w, w, w)</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The goal is to get all of the objects onto the east bank of the river. In other words, to reach state:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(e, e, e, e)</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A loss occurs whenever the goat eats the cabbage or the wolf eats the goat. This can occur in six possible ways:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"></p>

          <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(e, w, w, e)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(w, e, e, w)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">– where the wolf can eat the goat</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(e, e, w, w)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(w, w, e, e)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">– where the goat can eat the cabbage</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(e, w, w, w)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(w, e, e, e)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">– where the goat can eat the cabbage</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-left: 2.5in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and the wolf can eat the goat</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">These states, which result in a loss, are often called “dead states”</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now that we know how to represent the problem and to recognize the goal state and dead states, all that is required to complete the state space representation of the problem is to determine the valid transitions that exist between states.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There are a total of eight possible transitions that can take place in the game. Two of these transitions involve the farmer traveling across the river alone (either from west to east or east to west). These two transitions may be represented by the following “rules.”</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(1) (w, LocWolf, LocGoat, LocCabbage)</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(e, LocWolf, LocGoat, LocCabbage)</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(2) (e, LocWolf, LocGoat, LocCabbage)</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(w, LocWolf, LocGoat, LocCabbage)</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The first rule represents the farmer moving from the west bank to the east bank. The second rule represents his movement from the east bank to the west bank.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The left hand side of each rule (the part that precedes the arrow) specifies a pattern to be matched. In the case of Rule 1, the pattern indicates that the farmer must be on the west bank of the river for the rule to be applicable. The locations of the other three objects (wolf, goat, and cabbage) are not specified by Rule 1. The right hand side of the rule (the part that follows the arrow) specifies a replacement pattern. For Rule 1, the location of the farmer is set to east and the locations of the other three objects are left unchanged. Applying Rule 1 to a state in which the farmer’s location is “w” generates a new state, identical to the first, with the exception that the farmer’s location is set to “e” – thus modeling the movement of the farmer from the west bank to the east bank of the river.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The other six rules are:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(3) (w, w, LocGoat, LocCabbage)</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(e, e, LocGoat, LocCabbage)</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">[in which the farmer and wolf cross the river together]</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(5) (w, LocWolf, w, LocCabbage)</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(e, LocWolf, e, LocCabbage)</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(6) (e, LocWolf, e, LocCabbage)</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(w, LocWolf, w, LocCabbage)</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">[in which the farmer and goat cross the river together]</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(7) (w, LocWolf, LocGoat, w)</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(e, LocWolf, LocGoat, e)</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This completes the state space description of the Farmer, Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage problem. The entire description is summarized in Figure 14.26.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">As was mentioned at the beginning of this section, the reason for constructing a state space is so that it may be searched in order to find the goal state. More specifically, we are interested in finding a</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>solution path</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">– a sequence of transitions (moves or decisions) that lead from the initial state to the goal state.

          <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0in;">Figure 14.27:<br />
          Complete search space of the Farmer, Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage problem</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Figure 14.27 presents all of the sixteen possible states that can exist in the Farmer, Wolf, Goat and Cabbage problem, along with the valid transitions between those states. States that represent a loss are marked with the label “Dead”. The initial state and goal state are also marked.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">An examination of Figure 14.27 shows that from the initial state where all participants are on the west bank of the river, exactly four things can happen. One possibility is that Rule 1 will be applied, indicating that the farmer travels to the east bank alone. If so, then the game is lost as the goat eats the cabbage and the wolf eats the goat. The second possibility is that Rule 3 will be applied, modeling the situation where the farmer and wolf travel across to the east bank together. This action also results in a loss, since the goat will immediately eat the cabbage. A third possibility is modeled by Rule 5; the farmer crosses the river with the goat, leaving the wolf and cabbage together on the west bank. This is an acceptable situation in which no one is eaten. The final possible action that can be taken from the initial state is modeled by Rule 7. Application of this rule indicates that the farmer and cabbage to travel across to the east bank, but since that leaves the wolf alone with the goat, a loss results.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 2; orphans: 2"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">From state <font face="Arial, serif">(e,w,e,w)</font> there are only two possible actions that can occur. Either the farmer takes the goat back to the east bank, as modeled by Rule 6; or the farmer returns to the west bank alone (Rule 2). Note that the application of Rule 6 at this point returns the problem to the initial state – the farmer took the goat across to the east bank then turned around and brought it back to the west bank. Algorithms that explore search spaces must be able to detect these kinds of loops to prevent them from “exploring” paths like Rule 5, Rule 6, Rule 5, Rule 6, Rule 5, Rule 6…, in which the farmer endlessly hauls the goat back and forth across the river in a never ending cycle.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">From state <font face="Arial, serif">(w,w,e,w)</font> three actions can occur. Rule 1, in which the farmer travels across to the east bank alone, could be applied at this point but that would simply return the problem to the previous state <font face="Arial, serif">(e,w,e,w)</font>. Rule 3 can be applied, indicating that the farmer and wolf travel across the river to the east bank where they join the goat, or Rule 7 can be applied, where the farmer and cabbage join the goat on the east bank. Either of the two resulting states, <font face="Arial, serif">(e,e,e,w)</font> or <font face="Arial, serif">(e,w,e,e)</font>, are acceptable in the sense that nothing gets eaten.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One can continue to explore the space in this manner, tracing out the states that are reachable from <font face="Arial, serif">(e,e,e,w)</font> and <font face="Arial, serif">(e,w,e,e)</font> until the goal state is eventually encountered. Note that once the goal state is reached, the search algorithm must recognize this fact, so that the farmer can finally rest.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">As we have just seen, a diagram of the entire state space of a problem makes it relatively easy to see how that problem could be solved. The diagram of Figure 14.27 was generated by applying every applicable rule to the initial state of the Farmer, Wolf, Goat, Cabbage problem and all subsequent states until no new states could be generated. How can this process of state generation and exploration be organized?</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There are two common procedures for searching a state space. These are breadth-first search and depth-first search. Beginning at the initial state,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>breadth-first</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">search considers all paths of length one, then all paths of length two, then three, etc, until it encounters the goal. The breadth-first strategy can be thought of as exploring all paths of equal length “in parallel”.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Depth-first</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">search, on the other hand, will explore a single path, corresponding to a single line of reasoning, or chain of events, until either the goal is reached or failure is certain. Only when it can determine that a path leads to failure does the algorithm back up and try an alternate route.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Figure 14.28 illustrates how breadth-first and depth-first searches of a sample state space would be conducted. The state space graph begins at an initial state from which three valid transitions could be applied. The left and right transitions lead to states that each support two additional transitions. The middle transition from the initial state leads to a state that supports three more transitions. All paths of length two lead to dead states, with the exception of the rightmost path, which leads to the goal.</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0in;"><img alt="fig14.27" src="../Images/fig14.27.JPG" /><br /></p>

          <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0in;">Figure 14.28:<br />
          Breadth-first verses depth-first search</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Part (a) of Figure 14.28 illustrates a breadth-first search of the space. During breadth-first search, all three of the choices (transitions) that can be taken from the initial state are explored – generating three potential states. The transitions emanating from these three states are then explored in parallel.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Part (b) of Figure 14.28 illustrates a depth-first search of the same space. During depth-first search, a single path is explored until it reaches the goal or a dead end. If a dead end is encountered, the search backs up to the previous node in the space and applies another transition – equivalent to backing up and selecting a different choice. When all of the possible choices available from a node have been exhausted, depth-first search backs up to the next highest node. This pattern continues until either the goal is found or all choices available from all nodes reachable from the initial state have been exhausted.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The first path explored by depth-first search in Figure 14.28 is the left-most path, after two moves that path hits a dead state, so the search backs up to the node labeled “1” and tries the transition that leads to node “3”. Since node “3” is a dead end, the search backs up to node “1”, but since both transitions emanating from that node have already been explored, the search backs up to the initial state, node “0”. The second transition available at node “0” is then applied and the search continues.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Breadth-first search and depth-first search each have advantages and disadvantages. Breadth-first tends to use more memory than depth-first, since it has to keep up with all of the states on each of the paths that it is exploring. Depth-first tends to use less memory than breadth-first, since it only has to keep up with the states on the current path. A disadvantage of depth-first search is that some way of detecting loops in the search space must be implemented. Otherwise, depth-first can get caught in an endless loop exploring a path that leads nowhere. This problem is normally solved by having the algorithm check the current state on the active path against each of the past states on that path to see whether the current state has already been visited. If so, this current state is treated the same as a dead end, and the algorithm backs up to try another path.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Despite their differences, both the breadth-first and depth-first algorithms are known as</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>blind searches</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">because they will continue to search blindly though the state space until the goal is reached or the entire space has been explored. While this is acceptable for small state spaces such as the Farmer, Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage problem, most interesting problems have tremendously large spaces that cannot be fully explored for practical reasons.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Consider, for example, a problem in which only two operations can be applied to each state. Further assume that each transition leads to a unique state (i.e., there are no loops in the states space). Under these assumptions, starting from the initial state, after one move there will be two possible states; after two moves four more states; after three moves eight more. In general, the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> move will add 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> states. Thus, the 10<sup>th</sup> move will add 2<sup>10</sup> or 1,024 states to the graph. After only 20 moves there will be millions of states in the graph – despite the restriction that only 2 operations can be applied at each stage.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In order to be able to explore deep into a state space without having to deal with an exponentially increasing number of states, heuristic searches are often used. A</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>heuristic</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is a “rule of thumb” – often a simple measurement that is used as an indicator of some other aspect of the problem that would be difficult or impossible to accurately measure. For example, people often use price as an indicator of quality. Although everyone knows that price and quality are very different things, we sometimes say things like “your new car must have cost you a fortune” when we mean that your new car is very nice. One reason we do things like this is because price is something that is easy to measure, while quality is much more difficult to accurately capture.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>heuristic search</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is a search that incorporates a heuristic to guide the direction pursued by the search. A simple heuristic for the game of checkers might be:</font></font></p>

          <p class="western"><font face="Arial, serif"><b>H = NumberOfOpponentPiecesCaptured – NumberOfYourPiecesLost</b></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This heuristic reflects the fact that in checkers the more pieces you have captured from your opponent and the fewer you have lost to him or her, generally the better off you are. A heuristic search employing H would first pursue paths that tend to increase H, because these paths are more likely to lead to a win.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A simple heuristic search that can be used in single player games (such as finding your way through a maze) is called “hill climbing”. <b>Hill Climbing</b> searches work by:</font></font></p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">generating all states that are one transition away from the current state,</font></font></p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">applying a heuristic function to each of these states,</font></font></p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">moving to the state with the highest heuristic value, and then</font></font></p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">repeating this process until the goal is reached.</font></font></p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">While hill climbing has some drawbacks, such as the fact that it can get stuck on what are called “local maximums” where every possible next move appears worse than the current state, given a good heuristic function hill climbing can frequently solve problems much more effectively than a blind search.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There are other, more complex, heuristic search algorithms, such as A* (pronounced “A star”) and mini-max, which overcome many of the shortcomings of hill climbing. Like hill climbing, A* is tailored for single player games. Mini-max is appropriate for two-player games. While additional details about these search procedures are beyond the scope of this book, the main thing to remember about heuristic searches is that they generally outperform blind searches because they incorporate knowledge about the problem being solved (or game being played) in order to concentrate effort in directions that are likely to lead to success – rather than searching blindly about for a solution.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">At about the same time that some computer scientists were studying ways of creating computer systems that could play games (late 1950’s and 1960’s), other computer scientists were thinking about the problem of how to build a system that could “reason”. Much of the early work on automated reasoning focused on constructing computer programs to carry out the rules of symbolic logic. A</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>symbolic logic</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, or formal logic, combines a way of representing information using symbols together with a collection of rules for manipulating those symbols, in order to reach logically valid conclusions.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The reason that symbolic logic was of such interest to computer scientists studying artificial intelligence is that these logics are capable of “reasoning” about concepts and ideas based purely on the form of the statements used to represent them. In other words, a symbolic logic can draw logically valid conclusions about a collection of statements based not on the meaning of those statements, but on the form in which they are written.</font><a href="../Text/FootNotes.html#sdfootnote36sym"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">There are many kinds of symbolic logics. In this chapter we will look at one logic, propositional logic, in some detail. 10</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Propositional logic</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, is a two-valued logic in which every concept or idea that the system can reason about is represented as a variable that can be either</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>true</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">or</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>false</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">. For example:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">= It is raining.</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">= I am wet.</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">R</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">= I am outside.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">R</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">are propositional variables, each of which may be either true or false. Each propositional variable represents a statement about the “real” world, which may also be either true or false.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In the above example, I chose to use the symbols</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">R</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">as the names of the propositional variables. The actual choice of variable names doesn’t really matter. I could just as easily have used</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">A</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">B</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">C</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">. However, to make it easy for humans to remember which propositional variable goes with which statement, meaningful names, such as</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">raining</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">wet</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">outside</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, are often used. To the propositional logic system these names are no better, or worse, than</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">R</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Logical operators can be used to combine propositional variables together to form compound statements. As with the underlying propositions, these compound statements will be either true or false. Whether a compound statement is true, or whether it is false, will depend on the truth values of the individual propositions along with the precise definitions of the logical operators used.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The meaning of each propositional logic operator can be defined using a truth table. A</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>truth table</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">lists all possible input configurations for a logical operator along with the resulting output (true or false) associated with those inputs. The three most common logical operators are</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>and</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>or</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>not</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.

The truth tables that define these operators are presented in Figure 14.29.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Each row of a truth table represents a possible set of circumstances, sometimes called a “world”. To the left of the vertical bar are the inputs to the operator. To the right of the vertical bar is the output value of the operator given those inputs. Hence, the first row of the</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>and</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">table of Figure 14.29 can be read as “when</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is true and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is true, then the statement</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is true”. The third row of this table means “when</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is false and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is true, then the statement</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is false”.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">One way to think of propositional logic is as a game that consists of manipulating symbols based on a set of rules. When humans first made up the game they could have chosen the rules to be anything they wanted. However, what makes the “propositional logic game” interesting and worth playing is that its rules were designed to reflect the reasoning behavior of Man. Because of the way the operators are defined, the conclusions reached in the game should match the human notion of what is reasonable.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Since it is critical that the logical operators be defined in a way that “makes sense” to a human, let’s take a few minutes to carefully examine the definitions of</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>and</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>or</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>not</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">to ensure that they reflect the meaning of their associated English words. The English sentence “It’s a warm and sunny day.” is considered to be a true statement only when both “warm day” and “sunny day” are true. If it is “not warm”, or “not sunny”, or both, the sentence is false. These four possibilities are accurately captured by the truth table for</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>and</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Likewise, the English sentence “Marcus would be happy being rich or famous.” would generally be considered true when either “Marcus would be happy being rich.” is true, or “Marcus would be happy being famous.” is true, or both are true. If Marcus would not really be happy being rich, nor would he really be happy being famous, then the original statement would be false. The truth table for</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>or</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">captures this meaning.</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0in;"><img alt="figure14.7" src="../Images/figure14.7.JPG" /><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><br /></font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Similarly, the English sentence “It is not cloudy.” is always true when the sentence “It is cloudy” is false and vice versa. The truth table for</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>not</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">( ~ ) captures the way humans use the word.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If the three logical operators of Figure 14.29 look familiar that is because their truth tables are identical to the</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>and</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>or</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>not</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">“logic gates” discussed in Chapter 13, Digital Circuit Design. In fact, logic gates are simply physical devices that implement logical operators.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In addition to</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>and</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>or</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>not</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, propositional logic includes a number of other operators. One such operator is</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>implies</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">which is written using the</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">symbol. Like all propositional logic statements, a statement written using the implication operator will be either true or false. The truth table definition of</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>implies</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is given in Figure 14.30.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The purpose of the implication operator is to capture the concept of an “if” statement as used in human languages. The symbol to the left of the arrow,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">in this case, is called the</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>premise</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">of the implication. The symbol to the right of the arrow,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is this case, is called the</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>conclusion</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">of the implication.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Before we go any further, it is important to convince ourselves that the truth table definition of implication does indeed capture the concept of an “if” statement. We will do so using the following English language sentence:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If you are in the pool then you are wet.”</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This statement can be rewritten in propositional logic as:</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">where the premise,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, is “you are in the pool” and the conclusion,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, is “you are wet”.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">When should this “if” statement be considered true? Well, clearly, the statement is true in the world where both</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">are true (i.e., where “you are in the pool” is true and “you are wet” is also true.). This case is captured by line one of the truth table.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">When is this “if” statement verifiably false? When you are in the pool yet still dry – as could happen, for example, in the world where the pool had been drained for cleaning. This situation is captured by line two of the truth table.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In order to understand the last two lines of the truth table, ask yourself this: What does the implication say about the conclusion,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">when the premise,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is false? In other words, what does the “if” statement say about whether or not you are wet when you are not in the pool? The answer is, of course, nothing at all – I might be dry when I’m not in the pool or I might be wet because I’m standing in the rain or taking a shower.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Thus, when you are not in the pool, either a true or a false value for wet is acceptable. Your being either wet or dry does not invalidate the “if” statement, so it is marked as true in either case. Though the “if” statement is considered true in the worlds where its premise,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, is false, we say the statement is “vacuously true” in these cases, since the implication says nothing useful about its conclusion,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">At the beginning of this section, formal logic was defined above as “a way to represent information using symbols, together with a collection of rules for manipulating those symbols to reach logically valid conclusions.” So far, we have concentrated on describing how concepts can be represented using propositions (symbols like</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">) and how the relationships between those propositions can be expressed using logical operators (symbols like</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">~</font></font> ⇒<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">).</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It is now time to begin looking at some of the rules for manipulating these symbols. We will examine two kinds of symbol manipulation rules:</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>substitution</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">rules and</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>inference</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">rules. The</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>substitution rules</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">allow us to replace one group of symbols with a logically equivalent group of symbols. These rules are often used to simplify an expression. The</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>inference rules</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">specify logically valid inferences that can be drawn from a collection of true statements. These rules allow us to determine the truth values of one or more propositions, given the truth values of other propositions.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The three most common and useful equivalences in propositional logic are:</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0in;"><img alt="logicState4" src="../Images/logicState4.JPG" /><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><br /></font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">We say these expressions are</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>equivalent</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">because in all worlds where one is true, so is the other; and in all worlds where one is false, so is the other. Thus, they have identical truth tables, and since truth tables provide the definition of an expression’s meaning, these expressions mean the same thing – they are equivalent.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; widows: 0; orphans: 0"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The first equivalence,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ ~ P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">equivalent to</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, corresponds to the notion that “double negation” cancels. The expression</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ ~ P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">will always be true when</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is true, and will always be false whenever</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is false. Though we normally avoid double negation in English, we do occasionally say things like “I’m not unhappy.” where “unhappy” means “not happy”. Since, “not unhappy” or “not not happy” means “happy”, saying “I’m not unhappy.” is essentially equivalent to saying “I’m happy.”</font></font><a href="../Text/FootNotes.html#sdfootnote37sym"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

          <p class="western">Figure 14.31: Three useful propositional logic equivalences</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Figure 14.31 presents truth tables illustrating the validity of the three equivalences. Note that some of the tables have “extra” columns in addition to the input and output columns. These columns, which are shaded gray, are used to hold temporary results and make the construction of the final output column easier to follow. For example, to generate the truth table for</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~P</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">I first negated</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, then I negated</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, then I applied the</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>or</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">operator to those results.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It is possible to substitute one equivalent expression for another without changing the meaning of what is being represented, since the “meaning” of a propositional expression is fully defined by its truth table. For example consider the following statement:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">On sunny days weddings are held in the garden.”</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This statement could be roughly approximated by the propositional expression:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(1)</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">sunny_day</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">garden_wedding</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">From the equivalences given in Figure 14.31, we know that this expression could be replaced with the following:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(2)</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ sunny_day</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">garden_wedding</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">These two expressions, (1) and (2), are “logically equivalent”, but does the result of the substitution still make sense to a human? With some thought we can see that the answer to this question is “yes”. The new form of the statement, (2), would roughly translate back into English as:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Either it is not a sunny day or weddings will be held in the garden”.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Upon reflection, you should be able to see that statements (1) and (2) are expressing the same idea. When one is true, the other is true. When one is false, so is the other. If you have trouble seeing this, look back at the truth tables for</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ P</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">in part (b) of Figure 14.31 and think carefully about the circumstances represented by each row.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The final equivalence, presented in part (c) of Figure 14.31, make sense as well. Suppose I were to say to you:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Conan The Barbarian is not both smart and strong.”</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">That sentence conveys the same information as the statement:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in">“<font size="3" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Either Conan The Barbarian is not smart or Conan The Barbarian is not strong.”</font><a href="../Text/FootNotes.html#sdfootnote38sym"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In other words,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ ( strong</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">smart )</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is equivalent to</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">( ~ strong</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ smart )</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now that we have some idea about how one expression can be substituted for an equivalent expression, let’s turn our attention to the problem of identifying rules for “reasoning” in propositional logic. We will cover three simple, but very powerful, inference rules:</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>modus ponens</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>modus tollens</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>chaining of implication</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

          <p class="western">Figure 14.32: A truth table illustrating the derivation of <i>Modus Ponens</i></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If I were to say the following two things to you:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">“<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If Josh is at home then he is playing Halo.”</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">“Josh is at home.”</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Assuming</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">you believed these two statements to be true, that I am not lying to you or mistaken, you would probably immediately conclude that Josh is playing Halo. This conclusion is logically valid in all worlds in which both original statements are true.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If we assign the propositional variable</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">to “Josh is at home”, and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">to “Josh is playing Halo”, the statement “If Josh is at home then he is playing Halo” becomes</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">. Our reasoning process can then be captured by the inference rule known as</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Modus Ponens</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">:</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0in;"><img alt="logicState5" src="../Images/logicState5.JPG" /><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><br /></font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In other words, given “</font></font><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>implies</i></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">” and given “</font></font><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">” we can conclude “</font></font><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">”.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The truth table definition of Modus Ponens is presented in Figure 14.32. Note that Modus Ponens is a</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>tautology</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">– a logical expression that is true in all worlds, regardless of the underlying truth values of</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Modus Ponens is a very important rule since it allows propositional logic systems to draw logically valid inferences. Because of its importance, let’s analyze the truth table of this rule very carefully. Columns one and two of the table represents the variables used in the expression,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">. All four combinations of</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">are illustrated – representing the four possible worlds generated by this two variable system. The third column holds the truth values associated with the expression</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, which were copied from the definition of</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>implies</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">given in Figure 14.30. Since column three contains “intermediate results” it is shaded gray. Column four,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">((P</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q)</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P)</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, was generated by applying the</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>and</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">operator defined in Figure 14.29 to the inputs in column three,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and column one,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Since this column also contains “intermediate results” it is shaded gray. Finally, column five was generated by applying the definition of</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>implies</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">to column four,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">((P</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q)</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font><font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P)</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, as the premise and column two,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, as the conclusion.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Line one of the truth table corresponds to the world in which the “if” statement,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> ⇒&nbsp;<font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and its premise</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">are both true. In that world, the conclusion</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is also true. This first world is the one you usually think about. In our example, this world corresponds to the one where the statement “If Josh is at home he is playing Halo” is true and also the statement “Josh is at home” is true. In this world, “Josh is playing Halo” is also true.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Line two of the truth table represents the world in which the “if” statement is false. In our example, this world corresponds to the situation in which you know Josh to be at home but you also know he is not playing Halo, which means that the statement “If Josh is at home he is playing Halo” must be false.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Lines three and four represent the worlds in which</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is false. In our example, Josh is not at home. When Josh is not at home, we can conclude nothing about whether he is playing Halo – he may be (line 3) or he may not be (line 4).</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Thus, even though the Modus Ponens inference rule is valid in all worlds, we can safely conclude that Q is in fact true in only one world – the world corresponding to line one of the truth table, where both the implication</font>&nbsp;P&nbsp;</font>⇒<font size="3">&nbsp;Q</font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is true and its premise</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is also true.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Let’s now turn our attention to another inference rule, Modus Tollens. To begin, if I were to say to you:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">“<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If Josh is at home then he is playing Halo.”</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">“Josh is not currently playing Halo.”</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">You would most likely conclude that Josh is not home – assuming you had no reason to question the accuracy of what I was telling you. You make this deduction because the only way that the implication can be true while its conclusion is false, is for its premise to also be false. In other words, the only way “If Josh is at home then he is playing Halo” can be true at the same time that “Josh is playing Halo” is false is for “Josh is home” to also be false.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If the propositional variable</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is bound to “Josh</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>is</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">at home” and the propositional variable</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is bound to “Josh</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>is</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">playing Halo”, the above line of can be formalized as the inference rule Modus Tollens.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Modus Tollens</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">can be expressed in propositional logic as</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The truth table definition of Chaining of Inference is given in Figure 14.34.

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">While Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, and Chaining of Implication are valid rules in all possible worlds, they are usually used to reason about worlds in which we know, or assume, that a given group of statements are true and we want to determine whether there are any additional statements that must also be true given what we already know. For example, consider the following six statements, all of which we deem to be true.</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(1) If you go swimming you will get wet.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">These statements could be expressed in propositional logic in the following way</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0in;"><img alt="logicState" src="../Images/logicState.JPG" /></p>

          <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in;"><font face="Times New Roman, serif" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><font size="3">Assuming these statements are true, can we determine whether any additional statements are also true?

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It is also possible, although a little more difficult, to determine from these statements that it is not raining.

In other words, we now know that due to the fact that you are not wet “either it is not raining or you are not outside” must be true. Since statement (5) tells us that you are, in fact, outside; it must be true that “it is not raining.” In propositional logic this relationship would be expressed as:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Proof that this implication is valid is left as an exercise.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Since we now know</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ rain</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is true and statement (6) tells us</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">warm</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is true, the expression</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(warm</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ rain)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">must also be true by the definition of</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>and</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.

In other words, it’s a pleasant day.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">To summarize, using a small number of inference and substitution rules, we were able to determine that the following three things must be true:</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(7)</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ swimming</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(9)</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">pleasant</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">These propositional logic statements correspond to the English sentences:</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(7) You are not swimming.</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(8) It is not raining.</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(9) It is a pleasant day.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">When you stop for a moment to contemplate this example, it is hard not to be impressed with the power of propositional logic. In a few short pages we were able to describe a system that can be used to encode the relationships between concepts like “rain”, “wet”, and “swimming”, and draw logically valid conclusions from those relationships. This is true in spite of the fact that the propositional logic system has no idea what the words “rain”, “wet”, and “swimming” actually mean. It has no knowledge of what water is, that some people can swim in water, what it feels like to be wet, or even that people need to drink water to live.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Propositional logic systems “understand” very few things. They “understand” that every propositional variable must be either “true” or “false”, but not both. They “understand” a small number of words:</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>and</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>or</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>not</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>implies</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">– words whose meanings were fully defined via truth tables. They “understand” that equivalent expressions, those with identical truth values in all worlds, may be freely substituted for one another. And they “understand” that inference rules, such as</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Modus Ponens</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Modus Tollens</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>Chaining of Implication</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">can be applied under certain circumstances to some propositions to deduce the truth values of other propositions.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The simplicity of propositional logic systems and their lack of knowledge about the subject areas they can be applied to, make the results they are capable of achieving all the more impressive.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">As powerful as propositional logic systems are, they are but the simplest of an entire family of symbolic logic systems. Other systems such as</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>first order predicate logic</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>second order predicate logic</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">,</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>model logic</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, and others, overcome many of the weaknesses inherent in propositional logic and are even more powerful. However, they all boil down to symbol manipulation games – none require intuition, just the application of substitution and inference rules.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The mechanical nature of such systems is the reason why this author often refers to symbolic logic systems as accomplishing “reasoning without understanding”.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Conjunctive normal form is a particular way of writing logical expressions, where all of the expressions concerning a particular topic are combined together to form a single statement. <b>Conjunctive normal form</b> statements consist of a number of conjoined clauses (clauses joined by <i>and</i>), where each clause consists of either a single term or multiple disjoined terms (terms joined by <i>or</i>). Terms are individual propositional variables that may or may not be negated.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Any collection of propositional logic statements can be converted into conjunctive normal form using the equivalences introduced in the previous section. In order to convert the six statements of Figure 14.35(b) into conjunctive normal form, we first note that</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>all</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">six of the statements are assumed to be true.

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">where the statement numbers would be replaced with their associated propositions.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">To be in conjunctive normal form, each of the individual clauses, represented by statement numbers above, must consist of either a single term or multiple terms that are joined together by</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>or</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">. Referring to Figure 14.35(b), clause (5)</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">outside</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and clause (6)</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">warm</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, are in the proper form. Also, since a negated propositional variable is a valid term, clause (4)</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ wet</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is ok.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clauses (1), (2), and (3) require some work since they use both the</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>implies</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>and</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">operators.

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clause (1) is now in the correct form since it consists of two disjoined (</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>or</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">ed) terms.

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The next step is to apply the substitution</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ ( P</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Q )</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">equivalent to</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~P</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ Q</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, giving:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Clause (2) is now in proper form. Getting clause (3) into proper form depends only on recognizing that double negatives cancel themselves out. In other words,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ ~ P</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is equivalent to</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">P</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This completes our conversion of the statements of Figure 14.35(b) into the conjunctive normal form shown in Figure 14.35(c).</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">While the conjunctive normal form version of the statements may not be as clear to a human being as the original six statements, we can be sure that this version has exactly the same “meaning” since we were careful to only make logically equivalent substitutions at each step of the conversion process.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">If conjunctive normal form expressions are difficult for people to read and comprehend, why study them at all? The reason for converting logical expressions into conjunctive normal form is so that the proof technique known as resolution may be applied. A</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>proof technique</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is a procedure for showing that a statement logically follows from a set of premises.</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>Resolution</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is a proof technique that works on conjunctive normal form expressions by (1) selecting two clauses that contain conflicting terms, (2) combining the terms contained in those two clauses, and then (3) canceling the terms that conflict. What makes resolution so important is that this one simple technique is capable of performing the same kinds of reasoning tasks as Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Chaining of Implication, and many other logical operations.</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in;"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Here is an example illustrating how resolution can perform Chaining of Implication. Given the two statements:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">By combining these two clauses together and canceling the conflicting terms,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">at_the_beach</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ at_the_beach</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, we can produce a third clause:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">It is often the case that we have a collection of information about some situation and we wish to know whether some other piece of information must also be true given what we already know. In the previous section we showed that given the six true statements about a summer day presented in Figure 14.12, three additional statements could be deduced:</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(7) You are not swimming.</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(9) It is a pleasant day.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In order to prove these three statements true, we needed to use a number of inference and substitution rules, such as modus ponens and modus tollens. Given the original six statements in conjunctive normal form, each of the three additional statements can be shown true using a single proof technique known as the</font></font> <b><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>resolution refutation proof</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></b></p>

Like every</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>proof by contradiction</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, you begin by assuming the opposite of what you wish to prove, and then show that this “fact” would lead to a contradiction. For example, the following two statements are mutually inconsistent – they cannot both be true at the same place and time:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">(1) It is raining.</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">( raining )</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">When you resolve these two clauses you get</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">( )</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, the empty clause. In resolution refutation proofs, the empty clause represents a contradiction, or inconsistent set of statements. In other words, implied in your set of “true” statements is the assertion that a proposition is both true and untrue at the same time – which is impossible: a proposition must be either “true” or “false”, not both.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">For resolution refutation proofs to produce logically valid conclusions the original set of statements that are assumed true must be</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>consistent</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">– the statements must not imply that some propostion is both “true” and “false” at the same time. Given that the original statements are consistent, when a contradiction is detected in a resolution refutation proof, the source of the contradiction must be the statement you assumed true at the start of the refutation proof. Proving the assumed statement is false implies that its opposite (negation) must be true.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Figure 14.37 illustrates a resolution refutation proof of “You are not swimming” using the facts about a summer day given in Figure 14.35. Since we want to prove</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">~ swimming</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">we begin the proof by assuming that its opposite,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">swimming</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, is true. We then look for a contradiction between our established set of facts about a summer day and this new assumption. First up,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(swimming)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and Statement 1,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">( ~ swimming</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">wet ),</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">can be resolved since they share matching terms. In order for both of these clauses to be true, the clause</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(wet)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">must be true. However,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(wet)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">can be resolved with Statement 4,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(~wet)</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, indicating a contradiction. Thus, given that the original six statements were true, the contradiction must have been caused by our assumption that</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(swimming)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">was true. Since</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(swimming)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">cannot be true,</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">(~ swimming)</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">must be true.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Here is this same argument recast into English.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 1in; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">To prove that “You are not swimming” we will assume that “You are swimming” and show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. Statement (1) says that either “You are not swimming” or “You are wet”, but since we are assuming that “You are swimming” then, logically, you must be wet. However, Statement (4) says, “You are not wet”. Hence, we have found a contradiction. If all of our original statements were true to begin with, our assumption “You are swimming” must be incorrect. So, we conclude, that you are not swimming.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Figure 14.38 illustrates another resolution refutation proof based on the summer day scenario of Figure 14.12 – this one is a proof that it is not raining. As in the above example, we begin by assuming the opposite of what we would like to prove (i.e., we assume it</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>is</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">raining) and show that this leads to a contradiction.</font></font></p>

Since the assumption that it is raining leads to a contradiction when combined with the known facts about the summer day given in Figure 14.35, we conclude that it is not raining.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">A final example is given in Figure 14.39, which uses a resolution refutation proof based on the summer day scenario of Figure 14.35 to show that “It is a pleasant day.” The proof starts out by assuming it is not a pleasant day. The clause <font face="Arial, serif">( ~ pleasant)</font> resolves with Statement (3) <font face="Arial, serif">( ~ warm</font> <font face="Symbol, serif"></font> <font face="Arial, serif">rain</font> <font face="Symbol, serif"></font> <font face="Arial, serif">pleasant )</font> to give <font face="Arial, serif">( ~warm</font> <font face="Symbol, serif"></font> <font face="Arial, serif">rain )</font> which resolves with Statement (3) <font face="Arial, serif">( warm )</font> giving <font face="Arial, serif">(rain)</font>. From that point on, the proof of Figure 14.39 is identical to the proof of Figure 14.38 since we have shown that assuming <font face="Arial, serif">( ~ pleasant )</font> implies <font face="Arial, serif">( rain )</font> and Figure 14.38 proved that <font face="Arial, serif">( rain )</font> is untrue.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Since there is always a single conclusion in the head of a Prolog statement, Prolog rules always translate to conjunctive normal form expressions in which one, and only one, term is not negated.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Before closing out this section on symbolic logic, it is important to emphasize once again that the logic studied here, propositional logic, is just one type of symbolic logic. As an example, you may have noticed the above “translation” of Prolog rules to conjunctive normal form did not account for variables. Real Prolog statements generally include variables in their rules as a way of making those rules more general. The Prolog rule:</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Courier New, serif"><font size="3">mother(X,Y) :- parent(X,Y), female(X).</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">means</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">X</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is the mother of</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Y</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">if</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">X</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is a parent of</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">Y</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">and</font></font> <font face="Arial, serif"><font size="3">X</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">is female. Propositional logic does not support variables “within” a proposition. Prolog is actually based on a similar but more powerful logic, known as</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>predicate logic</i></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, which does allow the use of variables. These variables allow us to write general rules that define relationships (such as “mother”) without having to specify the individual participants in that relationship.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">As was discussed in Section 14.2 many of the recent advances in AI, such as progress in speech recognition and automatic translation, have been due to both big data and the resurgence of interest in machine learning techniques – systems that learn from examples instead of being explicitly programmed for every eventuality.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In this section we examine one particular approach to machine learning – a simple neural network model called the</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>perceptron</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">– and explore some of its features and limitations. Perceptrons are one of the oldest neural network models and the first to gain widespread popularity in the 1960’s. While perceptrons are no longer used in practice today, this relatively simple, biologically inspired computing model provides a good starting point for getting your head around the notion of machine learning systems.</font></font></p>

          <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in;"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Human brains are composed of trillions of individual nerve cells, called <b>neurons</b>. The major components of biological neurons are illustrated in Figure 14.17. Like all cells, neurons have a <i>nucleus</i> that keeps the neuron alive and functioning. In addition, neurons have a large number of branched protrusions, called <b>dendrites</b>, that receive chemical signals from other neurons. Neurons also have long thin fiber-like appendages, called <b>axons</b>, down which they send electro-chemical signals. At the end of a neuron’s axon are branch-like structures that come in contact with the dendrites of other neurons. In response to the signals it receives from other neurons, a neuron may fire – sending an electro-chemical pulse down its axon in order to transmit signals to other neurons.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Neurons are not in direct physical contact with one another. Instead, there are tiny gaps, called</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>synapses</b></font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">, between the dendrites of one neuron and the axons of others. The signals that pass between neurons must cross these synaptic gaps. This is accomplished by the signaling neuron releasing</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><i>neurotransmitter</i></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">chemicals into the synapse. A synapse may be either excitatory or inhibitory. Signals arriving at</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>excitatory synapses</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">increase the likelihood that the receiving neuron will fire. Signals arriving at</font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><b>inhibitory synapses</b></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">decrease the likelihood of the neuron firing.</font></font></p>

The inputs to a perceptron, on the other hand, can be arbitrary real numbers – positive, zero, or negative, with fractions allowed. In Figure 14.41, these inputs are indicated by X</font></font><sub><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">1</font></font></sub> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">through X</font></font><sub><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">n</font></font></sub><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In order to model the fact that biological neurons possess both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and the fact that these characteristics appear to vary in strength from synapse to synapse, every input received by the perceptron is multiplied by a “weight”. As is the case with the inputs themselves, weights are real numbers. They may be positive, zero, or negative, and fractions are allowed.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Once the inputs have been “weighted”, they are sent to a summation unit that adds them together. In Figure 14.41, the box labeled</font></font> <font face="Symbol, serif"><font size="3"></font></font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">represents this summation unit. The sum of the weighted inputs is then sent to a threshold comparator, the rightmost box in Figure 14.41. Every perceptron will have an internal threshold value that controls how sensitive it is to its inputs. If the weighted sum of a perceptron’s inputs is greater than its internal threshold value, then the perceptron will fire (generate a “1”), otherwise the perceptron will not fire (it generates a “0”).</font></font></p>

          <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Figure 14:42: An N-input perceptron with a fixed threshold</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Because each input is multiplied by a weight, large positive weights increase the affect of a positive input, while smaller positive weights decrease the affect of an input. A weight of zero causes a perceptron to ignore an input. Negative weights, when applied to positive input values, decrease the likelihood of a perceptron firing. In general, when considering positive inputs, positive weights model excitatory synapses – the larger the weight the greater the excitatory effect. Negative weights model inhibitory synapses.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">As a perceptron learns, it adjusts the values of its weights and its internal threshold. In fact, the only way a perceptron can “learn” is to adjust its weights and threshold – those are the only things the perceptron can be said to “know”.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The standard model of a perceptron can be modified slightly, as illustrated in Figure 14.42, in order to use a fixed-value threshold comparator. The most common fixed value to compare against is zero. If the weighted sum of the inputs is greater than zero the perceptron fires, otherwise it does not. In order to use a zero value threshold comparator, the “real” threshold will be negated and treated as a weight (W<sub>0</sub>) attached to an input port ( X<sub>0</sub>) fixed at “1”. This modification of the model is simply a computational convenience – it allows us to treat the threshold just like any other weight, but it doesn’t change what the perceptron is capable of learning.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In order to understand the way this modification works, think of a standard perceptron, based on the diagram of Figure 14.41, that has a threshold of five. This perceptron would fire if:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Thus, in general, a perceptron will fire when:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3"><font face="Arial, serif">( 1 × W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">0</font></sub><font face="Arial, serif">) + ( X</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">1</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">× W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">1</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">) + ( X</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">2</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">× W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">2</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">) + ( X</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">3</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">× W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">3</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">) + . . . + ( X</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">n</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">× W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">n</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">) &gt; 0</font></font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now that we understand what perceptrons are and how they work, it is time to turn our attention to how they can be taught. In order to keep the discussion from becoming overly complex, we will concentrate on teaching a single two-input perceptron to distinguish the difference between two types of objects. Meaningful perceptron-based systems include many perceptrons (not just one) each of which has many inputs (not just two). However, the principles underlying how such systems learn are the same as those described here.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">In order for a perceptron to learn, it must be trained. Training involves presenting the perceptron with a group of inputs known as a “training set”. At the beginning of the training process the perceptron makes “random” guesses as to whether or not it should fire when presented with a particular input. Whenever the perceptron guesses wrong its weights, including the threshold <font face="Arial, serif">W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">0</font></sub>, will be adjusted by the <i>perceptron learning rule</i>. After being adjusted, the training set will be presented to the perceptron again. If the perceptron generates any incorrect results, the learning rule will be applied again. This process will continue until the perceptron correctly classifies all members of the training set.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Figure14.43 illustrates portions of the perceptron learning process. Part (a) of the figure presents the examples that the perceptron will be trained on. The training examples are plotted on a two-dimensional four-by-four grid. The horizontal axis corresponds to the <font face="Arial, serif">X</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">1</font></sub> input of the perceptron and the vertical axis corresponds to the <font face="Arial, serif">X</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">2</font></sub> input. Thus, in this example, inputs are expected to vary in the range 1 – 4. In such a simple system, there are only 16 possible inputs (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (2,2)… etc. Our goal is to teach the perceptron to fire on the two elements located at positions (3,1) and (3,2), and avoid firing on the other training elements. Note that when I say “the element at position (3,1), I mean the element where input <font face="Arial, serif">X</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">1</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">= 3</font> and input <font face="Arial, serif">X</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">2</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">= 1</font>.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Before a perceptron is fully trained, it can produce two kinds of incorrect outputs: false positives and false negatives. A false positive occurs when the perceptron fires when it should not have. False negatives occur when the perceptron does not fire when it should have. The perceptrron learning rule distinguishes between these two types of errors.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Figure 14.20, Part (b) shows the initial classification efforts of the perceptron when the weights are set to <font face="Arial, serif">W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">0</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">= -3.0</font>, <font face="Arial, serif">W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">1</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">= 0.0</font>, and <font face="Arial, serif">W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">2</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">= 1.0</font>. According to the figure, training elements (3,1) and (3,2) produce false negatives, and element (2,4) generates a false positive. The other elements happened to be classified correctly.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">How did this perceptron decide which examples to fire on and which not to fire on?</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">As we showed above, an N-input perceptron fires when:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">For a two-input perceptron, this simplifies to:</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">An amazing characteristic of the perceptron learning rule, proven by Rosenblatt in the early 1960’s, is that if it is theoretically possible for a perceptron to learn the training set you have presented it with, this algorithm will converge on that solution. In other words, if you run your training examples on the perceptron, modify the weights according to the learning rule, and then repeat the process over and over, eventually all examples will be properly classified. If the training set is “perceptron learnable”, the learning process is guaranteed to eventually halt.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Another remarkable feature of the perceptron learning rule is that it works no matter what values are chosen for the initial weights. Lucky guesses for the initial weights might get you to the solution faster than unlucky guesses, but either way the learning rule will “converge” on the solution (if there is one) in the end – regardless of how good or bad the initial guesses were.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Now, let’s apply this learning rule to the situation illustrated in Figure 14.43 (b) to generate a new weight set.

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Thus, after one pass through the training set, the perceptron weights have been changed from <font face="Arial, serif">W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">0</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">= -3.0</font>, <font face="Arial, serif">W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">1</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">= 0.0</font>, <font face="Arial, serif">W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">2</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">= 1.0</font> to <font face="Arial, serif">W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">0</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">= -2.78</font>, <font face="Arial, serif">W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">1</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">= 0.88</font>, and <font face="Arial, serif">W</font><sub><font face="Arial, serif">2</font></sub> <font face="Arial, serif">= 0.78</font> . Figure 14.20(c) illustrates the state of the perceptron at this point. The perceptron fires on training examples (2,4), (3,1) and (3,2); and does not fire on any of the other examples. All training examples save false positive (2,4) are classified correctly.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">At this point, the perceptron learning rule would be applied again and the weights updated. After six repetitions of the training process, all training examples would be correctly classified. This situation is illustrated in Figure 14.43(d).</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Ok, that was a lot of math. Let’s stop and take a breath for a moment.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Before we conclude this section on perceptrons, I’d like to address two related subjects: what it means for a problem to be “perceptron learnable”, and how previously trained perceptrons respond when presented with inputs they have not seen before.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">The point was made earlier that by using the perceptron learning rule we can teach a perceptron anything it can theoretically learn – anything that is “perceptron learnable”. What does that mean?</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Well, for a two-input problem, such as the one illustrated in Figure 14.43, the problem must be linearly separable. <b>Linearly separable</b> means that if you plot the elements of the training set on a two-dimensional grid, you must be able to separate the two output groups by a single straight line. Our example was learnable because it was linearly separable. In fact, if you look back at Parts (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 14.43 you can see the line, or <i>decision surface</i>, that separates the two output categories. The decision surface has a positive side (above) and a negative side (below). Any input lying above the decision surface will cause the perceptron to fire. Any input lying on or below the decision surface will cause the perceptron to fail to fire. Thus, the orientation of a perceptron’s decision surface completely describes the knowledge possessed by that perceptron.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">This restriction on what perceptrons can learn can be extended to perceptrons with more than two inputs. For a three-input perceptron, whose inputs can be plotted in a three-dimensional space, the two output categories must be separable by a 2-d plane. In general, for an N-input perceptron the two output categories must be separable by an N-1 dimensional hyper-plane.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">An understanding of decision surfaces lets us accurately predict how a trained perceptron will react when presented with a “new” input that it has never seen before. If that input is above its decision surface, the perceptron will fire, otherwise it will not. Referring back to Figure 14.43(d) we can say with assurance that presenting item (4,2) to the perceptron will cause it to fire. Similarly, we can know that item (2,3) will not cause the perceptron to fire.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">Understanding a perceptron’s reaction to items outside the training set is very important. Perceptrons, and other neural network based approaches to artificial intelligence are generally only useful when they can, in some sense, generalize what they have learned.</font></font></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">For example, say we wanted to teach a neural network based system to be able to distinguish between men and women from photographs of their faces. We would digitize a large number of male and female photographs, and then train the net on those photos. What we would expect at the end of the process is that the network has learned to distinguish between male and female facial features. We would be extremely disappointed if the only males and the only females the system could reliably classify were those it had been shown in the training set.</font></font></p>
