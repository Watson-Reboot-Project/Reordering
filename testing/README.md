Reordering
==========
Watson Reboot Project
---------------------

This repository hosts javascript code using `angularjs` and `jquery` to parse
xml files to be able to re-arrange elements in a web-book. Currently, there is
only the top level implemented, which will evolve into the `chapter` interface.
later, code for `sections` and `figures` will be added.
